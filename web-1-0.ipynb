    "Overall summary upto this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\" and \"Components of a Hypermedia System\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives."

    "## Picking A “Web Stack”\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate how web 1.0 applications work, we need to pick a server-side language and a library for handling HTTP requests. Colloquially, this is called our “Server-Side” or “Web” stack, and there are literally hundreds of options to choose from, many with passionate followings. You probably have a web framework that you prefer and, while we wish we could write this book for every possible stack out there, in the interest of simplicity (and sanity) we can only pick one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this book we are going to use the following stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) as our programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) as our web framework, allowing us to connect HTTP requests to Python logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) for our server-side templating language, allowing us to render HTML responses using a familiar and intuitive syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this particular stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the most popular programming language in the world, as of this writing, according to the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), a respected measure of programming language popularity. More importantly, Python is easy to read even if you aren’t familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the Flask web framework because it is simple and does not impose a lot of structure on top of the basics of HTTP request handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bare-bones approach is a good match for our needs: in other cases you might consider a more full-featured Python framework, such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which supplies much more functionality out of the box than Flask does.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Flask for our book, we will be able to keep our code focused on _hypermedia exchanges_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We picked Jinja2 templates because they are the default templating language for Flask. They are simple enough and similar enough to most other server-side templating languages that most people who are familiar with any server-side (or client-side) templating library should be able to understand them quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if this combination of technologies isn’t your preferred stack, please, keep reading: you will learn quite a bit from the patterns we introduce in the coming chapters and it shouldn’t be hard to map them into your preferred language and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this stack we will be rendering HTML _on the server-side_ to return to clients, rather than producing JSON. This is the traditional approach to building web applications. However, with the rise of SPAs, this approach is not as widely used a technique as it once was. Today, as people are rediscovering this style of web applications, the term “Server-Side Rendering” or SSR is emerging as the way that people talk about it. This contrasts with “Client-Side Rendering”, that is, rendering templates in the browser with data retrieved in JSON form from the server, as is common in SPA libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Contact.app we will intentionally keep things as simple as possible to maximize the teaching value of our code: it won’t be perfectly factored code, but it will be easy to follow for readers, even if they have little Python experience, and it should be easy to translate both the application and the techniques demonstrated into your preferred programming environment.\n",

This has some obvious drawbacks: if you aren’t comfortable with Python, for example, some example Python code in the book may be a bit confusing or mysterious at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel like you need a quick introduction to the language before diving into the code, we recommend the following books and websites:\n",

    "## Introducing Flask: Our First Route\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a simple but flexible web framework for Python. We’ll ease into it by touching on its core elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Flask application consists of a series of _routes_ tied to functions that execute when an HTTP request to a given path is made. It uses a Python feature called “decorators” to declare the route that will be handled, which is then followed by a function to handle requests to that route. We’ll use the term “handler” to refer to the functions associated with a route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create our first route definition, a simple “Hello World” route. In the following Python code you will see the `@app` symbol. This is the flask decorator that allows us to set up our routes. Don’t worry too much about how decorators work in Python, just know that this feature allows us to map a given _path_ to a particular function (i.e., handler). The Flask application, when started, will take HTTP requests and look up the matching handler and invoke it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    @app.route(\"/\") <1>\n",
    "    def index(): <2>\n",
    "        return \"Hello World!\" <3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple “Hello World” route\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Establishes we are mapping the `/` path as a route.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. The next method is the handler for that route.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Returns the string “Hello World!” to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `route()` method on the Flask decorator takes an argument: the path you wish the route to handle. Here we pass in the root or `/` path, as a string, to handle requests to the root path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This route declaration is then followed by a simple function definition, `index()`. In Python, decorators invoked in this manner apply to the function immediately following them. Therefore, this function becomes the “handler” for that route, and will be executed when an HTTP request to the given path is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name of the function doesn’t matter, we can call it whatever we’d like so long as it is unique. In this case we chose `index()` because that fits with the route we are handling: the root “index” of the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have the `index()` function immediately following our route definition for the root, and this will become the handler for the root URL in our web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The handler in this case is dead simple, it just returns a string, “Hello World!”, to the client. This isn’t hypermedia yet, but as we can see in [fig-helloworld], a browser will render it just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://hypermedia.systems/images/figure_2-1_hello_world.png#ai)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello World!\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, there’s our first step into Flask, showing the core technique we are going to use to respond to HTTP requests: routes mapped to handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Contact.app, rather than rendering “Hello World!” at the root path, we are going to do something a little fancy: we are going to redirect to another path, the `/contacts` path. Redirects are a feature of HTTP that allow you to redirect a client to another location with an HTTP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to display a list of contacts as our root page, and, arguably, redirecting to the `/contacts` path to display this information is a bit more consistent with the notion of resources with REST. This is a judgement call on our part, and not something we feel is too important, but it makes sense in terms of routes we will set up later in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change our “Hello World” route to a redirect, we only need to change one line of code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    @app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "    def index():\n",
    "        return redirect(\"/contacts\") <1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing “Hello World” to a redirect\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Update to a call to `redirect()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the `index()` function returns the result of the Flask-supplied `redirect()` function with the path we’ve supplied. In this case the path is `/contacts`, passed in as a string argument. Now, if you navigate to the root path, `/`, our Flask application will forward you on to the `/contacts` path.\n",

This will “preserve” the search value when a user does a search, so that when the results of a search are rendered the text input contains the term that was searched for. This makes for a better user experience since the user can see exactly what the current results match, rather than having a blank text box at the top of the screen.\n",

    "Note that factoring on the server-side tends to be coarser-grained than on the client-side: you tend to split out common _sections_ rather than create lots of individual components.
