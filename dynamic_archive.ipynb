    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", and \"More Htmx Patterns\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: A \"magic\" attribute that converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app. Swaps only `<body>` content, preserving `<head>` (scripts, styles already loaded). Avoids Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). History, back button, deep links still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout. Page-load JavaScript and third-party widgets may need adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Place `hx-boost=\"true\"` on parent, children inherit. Override with `hx-boost=\"false\"` on specific elements (e.g., file downloads that need normal browser behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally. Not all htmx features offer this; developer must decide if supporting no-JS users is worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception — too useful to exclude despite being implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed. The button itself becomes a standalone hypermedia control. Combined with `hx-target=\"body\"` and `hx-push-url=\"true\"` for correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Code 303 explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\" Prevents browser from repeating the DELETE on the redirected URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()` — not styleable, but zero additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers — added complexity the book skips for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted — always re-validate server-side). Uniqueness validation *requires* server — only the database knows if email exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event (default for inputs), htmx requests server validation and updates error span with response. Partial update — only the error message changes, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included. Sibling form data requires `hx-include` for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types. But firing on every keystroke wastes server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses before sending request. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger (`keyup delay:200ms changed`) to only fire when input value actually changes — ignores arrow keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice. Plain HTML anchor tags work; `hx-boost` makes them AJAX-powered automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`. Server returns full page; htmx extracts just the rows (including new \"Load More\" button for next page). No server-side changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping. Useful when server returns full page but you only want a fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click. `revealed` is a synthetic htmx event fired when element enters viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs — can't bookmark or share \"modal open\" state. Use sparingly (alerts, confirmations); prefer inline editing or separate pages for domain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually. Use \"visually hidden\" CSS pattern if element should remain accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Once internalized, many UX patterns become variations on this theme rather than separate problems. Active search, email validation, lazy loading — all follow the same pattern with different triggers, targets, and endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input. Issues request as user types (debounced), updates results without full page reload. Nearly identical to email validation pattern — same client-side approach, different server logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter. Combined with `keyup` for comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments (e.g., `rows.html` extracted from `index.html`). The same fragment serves two purposes: included in full page for normal requests, rendered alone for htmx partial updates. Central to htmx development.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position. Enables template factoring while keeping full-page rendering intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: htmx automatically adds headers to every request:\n",
    "    - `HX-Request`: Always \"true\" for htmx requests\n",
    "    - `HX-Trigger`: The `id` of the element that triggered the request\n",
    "    - `HX-Target`: The `id` of the target element\n",
    "    - `HX-Boosted`: \"true\" if request came from `hx-boost`\n",
    "    - `HX-Current-URL`: Browser's current URL\n",
    "    - Others: `HX-Prompt`, `HX-History-Restore-Request`, `HX-Trigger-Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks `request.headers.get('HX-Trigger')` to determine which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content (full page vs fragment) based on context. More specific than just checking `HX-Request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens a bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx involved — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page. This is why checking `HX-Trigger` (not just `HX-Request`) ensures bookmarks work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` (or relevant header) to responses. Tells caches (CDNs, proxies) to cache responses separately based on that header. Prevents serving partial HTML to regular browser requests from cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Adding `hx-push-url=\"true\"` updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button. Trade-off: each debounced keystroke creates a history entry, which may clutter browser history.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to an element (typically a spinner) to show during requests. The indicator element needs class `htmx-indicator`, which htmx auto-injects with `opacity: 0`. During requests, htmx adds `htmx-request` class, transitioning opacity to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests (like lazy loading), place the indicator *inside* the target element. When response arrives, it replaces the indicator via `innerHTML` — self-cleaning, no cleanup needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks (e.g., \"Slow 3G\"). Reveals UX issues with loading states that aren't visible on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast; expensive content loads separately. User can interact immediately while waiting content loads in background.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM. Used for lazy loading — request fires immediately when element appears on page.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport (uses Intersection Observer API internally). Makes lazy loading \"truly lazy\" — request only fires when user actually sees the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript. htmx provides these to enable patterns that would otherwise require custom JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page request → page renders with empty placeholder → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder. The secondary request *cannot* return before the main page because it's triggered by the element existing in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading may not reduce *total* load time (may even increase it slightly due to extra request). But *perceived* performance improves because users can interact immediately rather than staring at a blank screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link in a table row. Deletes contact and removes just that row, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives an empty string response, the target element is removed from DOM. Simple but powerful pattern for deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header. Server checks: if `HX-Trigger == 'delete-btn'`, redirect to list page; otherwise return empty string to remove row inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases during swap:\n",
    "    1. `htmx-swapping` class added to target\n",
    "    2. Brief pause (swap delay)\n",
    "    3. Class changes to `htmx-settling`, content swapped in\n",
    "    4. Brief pause (settle delay)\n",
    "    5. `htmx-settling` class removed\n",
    "    The pauses enable CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes to animate swaps. htmx adds/removes classes automatically — you just define what those classes look like (e.g., `opacity: 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` tells htmx to wait 1 second before swapping. Gives CSS transitions time to complete. Match the delay to your CSS transition duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` with CSS `tr.htmx-swapping { opacity: 0; transition: opacity 1s ease-out; }`. Row fades out, then is removed. No JavaScript required.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute to each row. Button uses `hx-delete` targeting the collection URL. htmx auto-includes all checked values for non-GET requests when inside a form.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list. Access via `request.form.getlist('name')` or `request.args.getlist('name')` in Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered (e.g., bulk delete from contact list), skip the redirect — just re-render the template directly. Redirect is only needed when navigating to a different view.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables optimizations like returning partial HTML based on request context. When using third-party APIs, fall back to `hx-select` for client-side filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Patterns from \"More Htmx Patterns\"**:\n",
    "- Active Search: Same pattern as email validation — trigger on input, debounce, swap results\n",
    "- Template Factoring: Extract reusable HTML fragments for partial responses\n",
    "- Header-Based Conditional Responses: Use `HX-Trigger` to return full page vs fragment\n",
    "- Lazy Loading: Defer expensive operations with `load` or `revealed` triggers\n",
    "- Inline Delete: Target specific row, return empty string, row disappears\n",
    "- CSS Transitions: Use `htmx-swapping` class + swap delay for animations\n",
    "- Bulk Operations: Wrap in form, checkboxes with same name, auto-include for non-GET\n",

    "Contact.app has come a long way from a traditional web 1.0-style web application: we’ve added active search, bulk delete, some nice animations, and a slew of other features. We have reached a level of interactivity that most web developers would assume requires some sort of Single-Page Application JavaScript framework, but we’ve done it using htmx-powered hypermedia instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at how we can add a final significant feature to Contact.app: downloading an archive of all the contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a hypermedia perspective, downloading a file isn’t exactly rocket science: using the HTTP `Content-Disposition` response header, we can easily tell the browser to download and save a file to the local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let’s make this problem more interesting: let’s add in the fact that the export can take a bit of time, from five to ten seconds, or sometimes even longer, to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we implemented the download as a “normal” HTTP request, driven by a link or a button, the user might sit with very little visual feedback, wondering if the download is actually happening, while the export is being completed. They might even give up in frustration and click the download hypermedia control again, causing a _second_ archive request. Not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a classic problem in web app development. When faced with potentially long-running process like this, we ultimately have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When the user triggers the action, block until it is complete and then respond with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Begin the action and return immediately, showing some sort of UI indicating that things are in progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking and waiting for the action to complete is certainly the simpler way to handle it, but it can be a bad user experience, especially if the action takes a while to complete. If you’ve ever clicked on something in a web 1.0-style application and then had to sit there for what seems like an eternity before anything happens, you’ve seen the practical results of this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option, starting the action asynchronously (say, by creating a thread, or submitting it to a job runner system) is much nicer from a user experience perspective: the server can respond immediately and the user doesn’t need to sit there wondering what’s going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the question is, what do you respond _with_? The job probably isn’t complete yet, so you can’t provide a link to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen a few different “simple” approaches in this scenario in various web applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Let the user know that the process has started and that they will be emailed a link to the completed process results when it is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Let the user know that the process has started and recommend that they should manually refresh the page to see the status of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Let the user know that the process has started and automatically refresh the page every few seconds using some JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these will work, but none of them is a great user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we’d _really_ like in this scenario is something more like what you see when, for example, you download a large file via the browser: a nice progress bar indicating where in the process you are, and, when the process is complete, a link to click immediately to view the result of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound like something impossible to implement with hypermedia, and, to be honest, we’ll need to push htmx pretty hard to make this all work, but, when it is done, it won’t be _that_ much code, and we will be able to achieve the user experience we want for this archiving feature."

    "## UI Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the implementation, let’s discuss in broad terms what our new UI should look like: we want a button in the application labeled “Download Contact Archive.” When a user clicks on that button, we want to replace that button with a UI that shows the progress of the archiving process, ideally with a progress bar. As the archive job makes progress, we want to move the progress bar along towards completion. Then, when the archive job is done, we want to show a link to the user to download the contact archive file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to actually do the archiving, we are going to use a python class, `Archiver`, that implements all the functionality that we need. As with the `Contact` class, we aren’t going to go into the implementation details of `Archiver`, because that’s beyond the scope of this book. For now you just need to know is that it provides all the server-side behavior necessary to start a contact archive process and get the results when that process is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Archiver` gives us the following methods to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `status()` \\- A string representing the status of the download, either `Waiting`, `Running` or `Complete`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `progress()` \\- A number between 0 and 1, indicating how much progress the archive job has made\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `run()` \\- Starts a new archive job (if the current status is `Waiting`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `reset()` \\- Cancels the current archive job, if any, and resets to the “Waiting” state\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `archive_file()` \\- The path to the archive file that has been created on the server, so we can send it to the client\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `get()` \\- A class method that lets us get the Archiver for the current user\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A fairly uncomplicated API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only somewhat tricky aspect to the whole API is that the `run()` method is _non-blocking_. This means that it does not _immediately_ create the archive file, but rather it starts a background job (as a thread) to do the actual archiving. This can be confusing if you aren’t used to multithreading in code: you might be expecting the `run()` method to “block”, that is, to actually execute the entire export and only return when it is finished. But, if it did that, we wouldn’t be able to start the archive process and immediately render our desired archive progress UI."

    "We now have everything we need to begin implementing our UI: a reasonable outline of what it is going to look like, and the domain logic to support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to start, note that this UI is largely self-contained: we want to replace the button with the download progress bar, and then the progress bar with a link to download the results of the completed archive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that our archive user interface is all going to be within a specific part of the UI is a strong hint that we will want to create a new template to handle it. Let’s call this template `archive_ui.html`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "To update the UI in this way, we need to set a good target for the updates. So, let’s wrap the entire UI in a `div` tag, and then use that `div` as the target for all our operations.\n",

    "<div id=\"archive-ui\" hx-target=\"this\" hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "That’s definitely progress, but we don’t exactly have the best progress indicator here: just some static text telling the user that the process is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to make the content update as the process makes progress and, ideally, show a progress bar indicating how far along it is. How can we do that in htmx using plain old hypermedia?\n",

    "The technique we want to use here is called “polling”, where we issue a request on an interval and update the UI based on the new state of the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polling? Really?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polling has a bit of a bad rap, and it isn’t the sexiest technique in the world: today developers might look at a more advanced technique like WebSockets or Server Sent Events (SSE) to address this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, say what one will, polling _works_ and it is drop-dead simple. You need to be careful not to overwhelm your system with polling requests, but, with a bit of care, you can create a reliable, passively updated component in your UI using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Htmx offers two types of polling. The first is “fixed rate polling”, which uses a special `hx-trigger` syntax to indicate that something should be polled on a fixed interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div hx-get=\"/messages\" hx-trigger=\"every 3s\"> <1>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed interval polling\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Trigger a `GET` to `/messages` every three seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This works great in situations when you want to poll indefinitely, for example if you want to constantly poll for new messages to display to the user. However, fixed rate polling isn’t ideal when you have a definite process after which you want to stop polling: it keeps polling forever, until the element it is on is removed from the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have a definite process with an ending to it. So, it will be better to use the second polling technique, known as “load polling.” In load polling, we take advantage of the fact that htmx triggers a `load` event when content is loaded into the DOM. We can create a trigger on this `load` event, and add a bit of a delay so that the request doesn’t trigger immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can conditionally render the `hx-trigger` on every request: when a process has completed we simply do not include the `load` trigger, and the load polling stops. This offers a nice and simple way to poll until a definite process finishes."

    "## Smoothing Things Out: Animations in Htmx\n",
    "\n",
    "As nice as this UI is, there is one minor annoyance: as the progress bar updates it “jumps” from one position to the next. This feels a bit like a full page refresh in web 1.0 style applications. Is there a way we can fix this? (Obviously there is, this why we went with a `div` rather than a `progress` element!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through the cause of this visual problem and how we might fix it. (If you’re in a hurry to get to an answer, feel free to jump ahead to “our solution.”)\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is a native HTML technology for smoothing out changes on an element from one state to another: the CSS Transitions API, the same one that we discussed in Chapter 4. Using CSS Transitions, you can smoothly animate an element between different styling by using the `transition` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look back at our CSS definition of the `.progress-bar` class, you will see the following transition definition: `transition: width .6s ease;`. This means that when the width of the progress bar is changed from, say 20% to 30%, the browser will animate over a period of .6 seconds using the “ease” function (which has a nice accelerate/decelerate effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "So why isn’t that transition being applied in our current UI? The reason is that, in our example, htmx is _replacing_ the progress bar with a new one every time it polls. It isn’t updating the width of an _existing_ element. CSS transitions, unfortunately, only apply when the properties of an existing element change inline, not when the element is replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reason why pure HTML-based applications can feel jerky and unpolished when compared with their SPA counterparts: it is hard to use CSS transitions without some JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is some good news: htmx has a way to utilize CSS transitions even when it replaces content in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The “Settling” Step in Htmx\n",
    "\n",
    "When we discussed the htmx swap model in Chapter 4, we focused on the classes that htmx adds and removes, but we skipped over the process of “settling.” In htmx, settling involves several steps: when htmx is about to replace a chunk of content, it looks through the new content and finds all elements with an `id` on it. It then looks in the _existing_ content for elements with the same `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is one, it does the following somewhat elaborate shuffle:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The _new_ content gets the attributes of the _old_ content temporarily.\n",
    "\n",

    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", \"More Htmx Patterns\", and \"A Dynamic Archive UI\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: A \"magic\" attribute that converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app. Swaps only `<body>` content, preserving `<head>` (scripts, styles already loaded). Avoids Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). History, back button, deep links still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout. Page-load JavaScript and third-party widgets may need adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Place `hx-boost=\"true\"` on parent, children inherit. Override with `hx-boost=\"false\"` on specific elements (e.g., file downloads that need normal browser behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally. Not all htmx features offer this; developer must decide if supporting no-JS users is worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception — too useful to exclude despite being implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed. The button itself becomes a standalone hypermedia control. Combined with `hx-target=\"body\"` and `hx-push-url=\"true\"` for correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Code 303 explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\" Prevents browser from repeating the DELETE on the redirected URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()` — not styleable, but zero additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers — added complexity the book skips for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted — always re-validate server-side). Uniqueness validation *requires* server — only the database knows if email exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event (default for inputs), htmx requests server validation and updates error span with response. Partial update — only the error message changes, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included. Sibling form data requires `hx-include` for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types. But firing on every keystroke wastes server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses before sending request. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger (`keyup delay:200ms changed`) to only fire when input value actually changes — ignores arrow keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice. Plain HTML anchor tags work; `hx-boost` makes them AJAX-powered automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`. Server returns full page; htmx extracts just the rows (including new \"Load More\" button for next page). No server-side changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping. Useful when server returns full page but you only want a fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click. `revealed` is a synthetic htmx event fired when element enters viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs — can't bookmark or share \"modal open\" state. Use sparingly (alerts, confirmations); prefer inline editing or separate pages for domain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually. Use \"visually hidden\" CSS pattern if element should remain accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Once internalized, many UX patterns become variations on this theme rather than separate problems. Active search, email validation, lazy loading — all follow the same pattern with different triggers, targets, and endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input. Issues request as user types (debounced), updates results without full page reload. Nearly identical to email validation pattern — same client-side approach, different server logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter. Combined with `keyup` for comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments (e.g., `rows.html` extracted from `index.html`). The same fragment serves two purposes: included in full page for normal requests, rendered alone for htmx partial updates. Central to htmx development.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position. Enables template factoring while keeping full-page rendering intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: htmx automatically adds headers to every request:\n",
    "    - `HX-Request`: Always \"true\" for htmx requests\n",
    "    - `HX-Trigger`: The `id` of the element that triggered the request\n",
    "    - `HX-Target`: The `id` of the target element\n",
    "    - `HX-Boosted`: \"true\" if request came from `hx-boost`\n",
    "    - `HX-Current-URL`: Browser's current URL\n",
    "    - Others: `HX-Prompt`, `HX-History-Restore-Request`, `HX-Trigger-Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks `request.headers.get('HX-Trigger')` to determine which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content (full page vs fragment) based on context. More specific than just checking `HX-Request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens a bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx involved — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page. This is why checking `HX-Trigger` (not just `HX-Request`) ensures bookmarks work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` (or relevant header) to responses. Tells caches (CDNs, proxies) to cache responses separately based on that header. Prevents serving partial HTML to regular browser requests from cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Adding `hx-push-url=\"true\"` updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button. Trade-off: each debounced keystroke creates a history entry, which may clutter browser history.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to an element (typically a spinner) to show during requests. The indicator element needs class `htmx-indicator`, which htmx auto-injects with `opacity: 0`. During requests, htmx adds `htmx-request` class, transitioning opacity to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests (like lazy loading), place the indicator *inside* the target element. When response arrives, it replaces the indicator via `innerHTML` — self-cleaning, no cleanup needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks (e.g., \"Slow 3G\"). Reveals UX issues with loading states that aren't visible on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast; expensive content loads separately. User can interact immediately while waiting content loads in background.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM. Used for lazy loading — request fires immediately when element appears on page.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport (uses Intersection Observer API internally). Makes lazy loading \"truly lazy\" — request only fires when user actually sees the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript. htmx provides these to enable patterns that would otherwise require custom JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page request → page renders with empty placeholder → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder. The secondary request *cannot* return before the main page because it's triggered by the element existing in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading may not reduce *total* load time (may even increase it slightly due to extra request). But *perceived* performance improves because users can interact immediately rather than staring at a blank screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link in a table row. Deletes contact and removes just that row, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives an empty string response, the target element is removed from DOM. Simple but powerful pattern for deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header. Server checks: if `HX-Trigger == 'delete-btn'`, redirect to list page; otherwise return empty string to remove row inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases during swap:\n",
    "    1. `htmx-swapping` class added to target\n",
    "    2. Brief pause (swap delay)\n",
    "    3. Class changes to `htmx-settling`, content swapped in\n",
    "    4. Brief pause (settle delay)\n",
    "    5. `htmx-settling` class removed\n",
    "    The pauses enable CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes to animate swaps. htmx adds/removes classes automatically — you just define what those classes look like (e.g., `opacity: 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` tells htmx to wait 1 second before swapping. Gives CSS transitions time to complete. Match the delay to your CSS transition duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` with CSS `tr.htmx-swapping { opacity: 0; transition: opacity 1s ease-out; }`. Row fades out, then is removed. No JavaScript required.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute to each row. Button uses `hx-delete` targeting the collection URL. htmx auto-includes all checked values for non-GET requests when inside a form.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list. Access via `request.form.getlist('name')` or `request.args.getlist('name')` in Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered (e.g., bulk delete from contact list), skip the redirect — just re-render the template directly. Redirect is only needed when navigating to a different view.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables optimizations like returning partial HTML based on request context. When using third-party APIs, fall back to `hx-select` for client-side filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "106. **Long-Running Process Problem**: Blocking until complete = bad UX (user stares at nothing for seconds). Non-blocking with immediate response = better UX (user sees progress immediately).\n",
    "\n",
    "107. **Common Async UI Patterns (Pre-htmx)**: Email when complete, manual refresh, auto-refresh with JS timer. All work but none are great UX.\n",
    "\n",
    "108. **Non-Blocking Design**: Server starts background job (thread), responds immediately with progress UI. Client polls for updates. User never waits without feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "109. **Polling**: Client repeatedly asks server \"are you done yet?\" at intervals. Simpler than WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) but often sufficient for definite processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "110. **Fixed-Rate Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"every 3s\"` — polls indefinitely on a timer. Good for ongoing updates (e.g., message feeds). Continues until element is removed from DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "111. **Load Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"load delay:500ms\"` — each response triggers the next request. Server controls continuation by including or omitting the trigger in the response. Better for processes with a definite ending.\n",
    "\n",
    "112. **Load Polling Chain**: Response includes `hx-trigger=\"load delay:Xms\"` → element loads into DOM → fires request after delay → new response → repeat. Omit trigger in final response to stop the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "113. **Same URL, Multiple Methods Pattern**: POST to `/contacts/archive` starts the job; GET checks status; DELETE resets/cancels. RESTful design — same resource, different operations via HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "114. **Single Template, Multiple States**: One template (`archive_ui.html`) handles all UI states (Waiting, Running, Complete) with Jinja `{% if %}` / `{% elif %}` blocks. Keeps related UI logic in one place for maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "115. **Archiver API Pattern**: `status()` returns state string, `progress()` returns 0-1 float, `run()` is non-blocking (starts background thread), `reset()` cancels job, `archive_file()` returns file path. Clean separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "116. **CSS Progress Bar**: Outer div (frame with background) + inner div (colored bar). Set inner div's `width` as percentage via inline style. More styleable than native `<progress>` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "117. **ARIA for Custom Widgets**: `role=\"progressbar\"` and `aria-valuenow=\"50\"` make div-based progress bars accessible to screen readers. Announces \"Progress bar, 50 percent\" instead of meaningless \"div.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "118. **File Downloads via HTTP**: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"archive.json\"` header tells browser to save response as file rather than display it. Flask's `send_file(..., as_attachment=True)` sets this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "119. **`hx-boost=\"false\"` for Downloads**: Opt out of AJAX for file download links. AJAX can't trigger browser's native save dialog — need normal link behavior. Inheritance means you must explicitly disable boost on download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "120. **CSS Transitions Don't Fire on Replacement**: Transitions animate property *changes* on existing elements. When htmx replaces an element entirely, there's nothing to transition *from* — the new element just appears at its final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "121. **htmx Settling Mechanism**: When swapping, htmx matches elements by `id`. For matched elements: (1) temporarily copies old element's attributes to new element, (2) swaps in new element, (3) after short delay, restores new element's actual attributes. This creates an attribute *change* that CSS can transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "122. **Stable ID Requirement**: For settling/smooth transitions to work, element needs the **same** `id` in both old and new HTML. Template produces same ID each time; only dynamic values (like width percentage) change.\n",
    "\n",
    "123. **Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting**: Scripting is acceptable in HDAs when it *enhances* rather than *replaces* hypermedia. Example: `_=\"on load click() me\"` (hyperscript) auto-clicks a download link — but the link still works without JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "124. **HTML Entities**: `&downarrow;` → ↓, `&amp;` → &, `&lt;` → <, `&copy;` → ©. Insert special characters in HTML. Purely visual — no functional meaning to browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "125. **Flask Context Processors**: `@app.context_processor` decorator lets you inject variables into all templates automatically, avoiding repetitive parameter passing in every route handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "126. **Markdown Soup**: Using Markdown elements for their *appearance* rather than semantic *meaning* (e.g., `_text_` for italics when `<cite>` is semantically correct for titles). Prefer embedded HTML or Markdown extensions when semantics matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Patterns from \"More Htmx Patterns\"**:\n",
