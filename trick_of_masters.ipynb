    "\n",
    "We’ll start with the `hx-swap` attribute. This is often not included on elements that issue htmx-driven requests because its default behavior — `innerHTML`, which swaps the inner HTML of the element — tends to cover most use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We earlier saw situations where we wanted to override the default behavior and use `outerHTML`, for example. And, in Chapter 2, we discussed some other swap options beyond these two, `beforebegin`, `afterend`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 5, we also looked at the `swap` delay modifier for `hx-swap`, which allowed us to fade some content out before it was removed from the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these, `hx-swap` offers further control with the following modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "`settle`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Like `swap`, this allows you to apply a specific delay between when the content has been swapped into the DOM and when its attributes are “settled”, that is, updated from their old values (if any) to their new values. This can give you fine-grained control over CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`show`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Allows you to specify an element that should be shown — that is, scrolled into the viewport of the browser if necessary — when a request is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scroll`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",

    "`focus-scroll`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Allows you to specify that htmx should scroll to the focused element when a request completes. The default for this modifier is “false.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, if we had a button that issued a `GET` request, and we wished to scroll to the top of the `body` element when the request completed, we would write the following HTML:\n",

    "```html\n",
    "<button hx-get=\"/contacts\" hx-target=\"#content-div\"\n",

    "</button>\n",

    "\n",
    "Like `hx-swap`, `hx-trigger` can often be omitted when you are using htmx, because the default behavior is typically what you want. Recall the default triggering events are determined by an element’s type:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Requests on `input`, `textarea` & `select` elements are triggered by the `change` event.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Requests on `form` elements are triggered on the `submit` event.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times, however, when you want a more elaborate trigger specification. A classic example is the active search example we implemented in Contact.app:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<input id=\"search\" type=\"search\" name=\"q\"\n",
    "  value=\"{{ request.args.get('q') or '' }}\"\n",

    "  1. An elaborate trigger specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "This example took advantage of two modifiers available for the `hx-trigger` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "`delay`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Allows you to specify a delay to wait before a request is issued. If the event occurs again, the first event is discarded and the timer resets. This allows you to “debounce” requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "`changed`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Allows you to specify that a request should only be issued when the `value` property of the given element has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`hx-trigger` has several additional modifiers. This makes sense, because events are fairly complex and we want to be able to take advantage of all the power they offer. We will discuss events in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the other modifiers available on `hx-trigger`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`once`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The given event will only trigger a request once.\n",
    "\n",
    "`throttle`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Allows you to throttle events, only issuing them once every certain interval. This is different than `delay` in that the first event will trigger immediately, but any following events will not trigger until the throttle time period has elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`from`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS selector that allows you to pick another element to listen for events on. We will see an example of this used later in the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "`target`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS selector that allows you to filter events to only those that occur directly on a given element. In the DOM, events “bubble” to their ancestor elements, so a `click` event on a button will also trigger a `click` event on an enclosing `div`, all the way up to the `body` element. Sometimes you want to specify an event directly on a given element, and this attribute allows you to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "`consume`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "If this option is set to `true`, the triggering event will be cancelled and not propagate to ancestor elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "`queue`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "This option allows you to specify how events are queued in htmx. By default, when htmx receives a triggering event, it will issue a request and start an event queue. If the request is still in flight when another event is received, it will queue the event and, when the request finishes, trigger a new request. By default, it only keeps the last event it receives, but you can modify that behavior using this option: for example, you can set it to `none` and ignore all triggering events that occur during a request."

    "Htmx offers many other less commonly used attributes for fine-tuning the behavior of your Hypermedia-Driven Application.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "hx-push-url\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "“Pushes” the request URL (or some other value) into the navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "hx-preserve\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Preserves a bit of the DOM between requests; the original content will be kept, regardless of what is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "hx-sync\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronized requests between two or more elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "hx-disable\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Disables htmx behavior on this element and any children. We will come back to this when we discuss the topic of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at `hx-sync`, which allows us to synchronize AJAX requests between two or more elements. Consider a simple case where we have two buttons that both target the same element on the screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button hx-get=\"/contacts\" hx-target=\"body\">\n",
    "  Get Contacts\n",
    "</button>\n",
    "<button hx-get=\"/settings\" hx-target=\"body\">\n",
    "  Get Settings\n",
    "</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Two competing buttons\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine and will work, but what if a user clicks the “Get Contacts” button and then the request takes a while to respond? And, in the meantime the user clicks the “Get Settings” button? In this case we would have two requests in flight at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `/settings` request finished first and displayed the user’s setting information, they might be very surprised if they began making changes and then, suddenly, the `/contacts` request finished and replaced the entire body with the contacts instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this situation, we might consider using an `hx-indicator` to alert the user that something is going on, making it less likely that they click the second button. But if we really want to guarantee that there is only one request at a time issued between these two buttons, the right thing to do is to use the `hx-sync` attribute. Let’s enclose both buttons in a `div` and eliminate the redundant `hx-target` specification by hoisting the attribute up to that `div`. We can then use `hx-sync` on that div to coordinate requests between the two buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our updated code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div hx-target=\"body\" <1>\n",
    "  hx-sync=\"this\"> <2>\n",
    "  <button hx-get=\"/contacts\">\n",
    "    Get Contacts\n",
    "  </button>\n",
    "  <button hx-get=\"/settings\">\n",
    "    Get Settings\n",
    "  </button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Syncing two buttons\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Hoist the duplicate `hx-target` attributes to the parent `div`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Synchronize on the parent `div`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By placing the `hx-sync` attribute on the `div` with the value `this`, we are saying “Synchronize all htmx requests that occur within this `div` element with one another.” This means that if one button already has a request in flight, other buttons within the `div` will not issue requests until that has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hx-sync` attribute supports a few different strategies that allow you to, for example, replace an existing request in flight, or queue requests with a particular queuing strategy. You can find complete documentation, as well as examples, at the htmx.org page for [`hx-sync`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sync/).\n",

    "2. **Event listeners** — Using `addEventListener()` to attach handler functions to events\n",
    "3. **Event objects** — The `e` parameter that gives you info about what happened (e.g., `e.target` is the element that triggered the event, `e.key` tells you which key was pressed)\n",
    "4. **Preventing default behavior** — Using `e.preventDefault()` to stop normal browser behavior (like form submission)\n",
    "5. **Event bubbling** — Events propagate up through ancestor elements (covered in the next article)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's important for htmx:**\n",
    "- htmx is built *on top of* the DOM event system. When you write `hx-trigger=\"click\"`, htmx is using `addEventListener()` under the hood.\n",
    "- Understanding `e.target` helps you understand how `HX-Trigger` headers work\n",

We took advantage of the `HX-Trigger` request header, which includes the id of the element that triggered a given request.\n",

This response header allows you to _trigger an event_ on the element that submitted an AJAX request. This turns out to be a powerful way to coordinate elements in the DOM in a decoupled manner.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even more important than response headers, in terms of information conveyed to the client, is the _HTTP Response Code_. We discussed HTTP Response Codes in Chapter 3. By and large htmx handles various response codes in the manner that you would expect: it swaps content for all 200-level response codes and does nothing for others. There are, however, two “special” 200-level response codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `204 No Content` \\- When htmx receives this response code, it will _not_ swap any content into the DOM (even if the response has a body)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can override the behavior of htmx with respect to response codes by, you guessed it, responding to an event! The `htmx:beforeSwap` event allows you to change the behavior of htmx with respect to various status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say that, rather than doing nothing when a `404` occurred, you wanted to alert the user that an error had occurred. To do so, you want to invoke a JavaScript method, `showNotFoundError()`. Let’s add some code to use the `htmx:beforeSwap` event to make this happen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "document.body.addEventListener('htmx:beforeSwap', evt => { <1>\n",
    "  if (evt.detail.xhr.status === 404) { <2>\n",
    "    showNotFoundError();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing a 404 dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Hook into the `htmx:beforeSwap` event.\n",

    "  2. If the response code is a `404`, show the user a dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `htmx:beforeSwap` event to configure if the response should be swapped into the DOM and what element the response should target. This gives you quite a bit of flexibility in choosing how you want to use HTTP Response codes in your application.

This technique addresses the general problem that comes up in Hypermedia-Driven Applications: “How do I update other content?” After all, in normal HTTP requests, there is only one “target”, the entire screen, and, similarly, in htmx-based requests, there is only one target: either the explicit or implicit target of the element.\n",

This has the tremendous advantage of being simple and reliable. The downside is that it may not provide the user experience that you want, and it may not play well with a particular server-side template layout. Regardless, we always recommend at least thinking about this approach first."

    "This feature is available _only_ in the console, so you can’t use it in code on your page. But, if you are working with htmx in Chrome, and are curious why an event isn’t triggering on an element, you can open the developers console and type the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", \"More Htmx Patterns\", \"A Dynamic Archive UI\", and \"Tricks Of The Htmx Masters\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: A \"magic\" attribute that converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app. Swaps only `<body>` content, preserving `<head>` (scripts, styles already loaded). Avoids Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). History, back button, deep links still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout. Page-load JavaScript and third-party widgets may need adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Place `hx-boost=\"true\"` on parent, children inherit. Override with `hx-boost=\"false\"` on specific elements (e.g., file downloads that need normal browser behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally. Not all htmx features offer this; developer must decide if supporting no-JS users is worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception — too useful to exclude despite being implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed. The button itself becomes a standalone hypermedia control. Combined with `hx-target=\"body\"` and `hx-push-url=\"true\"` for correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Code 303 explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\" Prevents browser from repeating the DELETE on the redirected URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()` — not styleable, but zero additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers — added complexity the book skips for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted — always re-validate server-side). Uniqueness validation *requires* server — only the database knows if email exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event (default for inputs), htmx requests server validation and updates error span with response. Partial update — only the error message changes, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included. Sibling form data requires `hx-include` for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types. But firing on every keystroke wastes server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses before sending request. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger (`keyup delay:200ms changed`) to only fire when input value actually changes — ignores arrow keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice. Plain HTML anchor tags work; `hx-boost` makes them AJAX-powered automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`. Server returns full page; htmx extracts just the rows (including new \"Load More\" button for next page). No server-side changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping. Useful when server returns full page but you only want a fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click. `revealed` is a synthetic htmx event fired when element enters viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs — can't bookmark or share \"modal open\" state. Use sparingly (alerts, confirmations); prefer inline editing or separate pages for domain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually. Use \"visually hidden\" CSS pattern if element should remain accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Once internalized, many UX patterns become variations on this theme rather than separate problems. Active search, email validation, lazy loading — all follow the same pattern with different triggers, targets, and endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input. Issues request as user types (debounced), updates results without full page reload. Nearly identical to email validation pattern — same client-side approach, different server logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter. Combined with `keyup` for comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments (e.g., `rows.html` extracted from `index.html`). The same fragment serves two purposes: included in full page for normal requests, rendered alone for htmx partial updates. Central to htmx development.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position. Enables template factoring while keeping full-page rendering intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: htmx automatically adds headers to every request:\n",
    "    - `HX-Request`: Always \"true\" for htmx requests\n",
    "    - `HX-Trigger`: The `id` of the element that triggered the request\n",
    "    - `HX-Target`: The `id` of the target element\n",
    "    - `HX-Boosted`: \"true\" if request came from `hx-boost`\n",
    "    - `HX-Current-URL`: Browser's current URL\n",
    "    - Others: `HX-Prompt`, `HX-History-Restore-Request`, `HX-Trigger-Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks `request.headers.get('HX-Trigger')` to determine which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content (full page vs fragment) based on context. More specific than just checking `HX-Request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens a bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx involved — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page. This is why checking `HX-Trigger` (not just `HX-Request`) ensures bookmarks work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` (or relevant header) to responses. Tells caches (CDNs, proxies) to cache responses separately based on that header. Prevents serving partial HTML to regular browser requests from cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Adding `hx-push-url=\"true\"` updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button. Trade-off: each debounced keystroke creates a history entry, which may clutter browser history.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to an element (typically a spinner) to show during requests. The indicator element needs class `htmx-indicator`, which htmx auto-injects with `opacity: 0`. During requests, htmx adds `htmx-request` class, transitioning opacity to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests (like lazy loading), place the indicator *inside* the target element. When response arrives, it replaces the indicator via `innerHTML` — self-cleaning, no cleanup needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks (e.g., \"Slow 3G\"). Reveals UX issues with loading states that aren't visible on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast; expensive content loads separately. User can interact immediately while waiting content loads in background.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM. Used for lazy loading — request fires immediately when element appears on page.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport (uses Intersection Observer API internally). Makes lazy loading \"truly lazy\" — request only fires when user actually sees the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript. htmx provides these to enable patterns that would otherwise require custom JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page request → page renders with empty placeholder → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder. The secondary request *cannot* return before the main page because it's triggered by the element existing in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading may not reduce *total* load time (may even increase it slightly due to extra request). But *perceived* performance improves because users can interact immediately rather than staring at a blank screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link in a table row. Deletes contact and removes just that row, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives an empty string response, the target element is removed from DOM. Simple but powerful pattern for deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header. Server checks: if `HX-Trigger == 'delete-btn'`, redirect to list page; otherwise return empty string to remove row inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases during swap:\n",
    "    1. `htmx-swapping` class added to target\n",
    "    2. Brief pause (swap delay)\n",
    "    3. Class changes to `htmx-settling`, content swapped in\n",
    "    4. Brief pause (settle delay)\n",
    "    5. `htmx-settling` class removed\n",
    "    The pauses enable CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes to animate swaps. htmx adds/removes classes automatically — you just define what those classes look like (e.g., `opacity: 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` tells htmx to wait 1 second before swapping. Gives CSS transitions time to complete. Match the delay to your CSS transition duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` with CSS `tr.htmx-swapping { opacity: 0; transition: opacity 1s ease-out; }`. Row fades out, then is removed. No JavaScript required.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute to each row. Button uses `hx-delete` targeting the collection URL. htmx auto-includes all checked values for non-GET requests when inside a form.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list. Access via `request.form.getlist('name')` or `request.args.getlist('name')` in Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered (e.g., bulk delete from contact list), skip the redirect — just re-render the template directly. Redirect is only needed when navigating to a different view.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables optimizations like returning partial HTML based on request context. When using third-party APIs, fall back to `hx-"

    "\n",
    "106. **Long-Running Process Problem**: Blocking until complete = bad UX (user stares at nothing for seconds). Non-blocking with immediate response = better UX (user sees progress immediately).\n",
    "\n",
    "107. **Common Async UI Patterns (Pre-htmx)**: Email when complete, manual refresh, auto-refresh with JS timer. All work but none are great UX.\n",
    "\n",
    "108. **Non-Blocking Design**: Server starts background job (thread), responds immediately with progress UI. Client polls for updates. User never waits without feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "109. **Polling**: Client repeatedly asks server \"are you done yet?\" at intervals. Simpler than WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) but often sufficient for definite processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "110. **Fixed-Rate Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"every 3s\"` — polls indefinitely on a timer. Good for ongoing updates (e.g., message feeds). Continues until element is removed from DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "111. **Load Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"load delay:500ms\"` — each response triggers the next request. Server controls continuation by including or omitting the trigger in the response. Better for processes with a definite ending.\n",
    "\n",
    "112. **Load Polling Chain**: Response includes `hx-trigger=\"load delay:Xms\"` → element loads into DOM → fires request after delay → new response → repeat. Omit trigger in final response to stop the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "113. **Same URL, Multiple Methods Pattern**: POST to `/contacts/archive` starts the job; GET checks status; DELETE resets/cancels. RESTful design — same resource, different operations via HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "114. **Single Template, Multiple States**: One template (`archive_ui.html`) handles all UI states (Waiting, Running, Complete) with Jinja `{% if %}` / `{% elif %}` blocks. Keeps related UI logic in one place for maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "115. **Archiver API Pattern**: `status()` returns state string, `progress()` returns 0-1 float, `run()` is non-blocking (starts background thread), `reset()` cancels job, `archive_file()` returns file path. Clean separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "116. **CSS Progress Bar**: Outer div (frame with background) + inner div (colored bar). Set inner div's `width` as percentage via inline style. More styleable than native `<progress>` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "117. **ARIA for Custom Widgets**: `role=\"progressbar\"` and `aria-valuenow=\"50\"` make div-based progress bars accessible to screen readers. Announces \"Progress bar, 50 percent\" instead of meaningless \"div.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "118. **File Downloads via HTTP**: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"archive.json\"` header tells browser to save response as file rather than display it. Flask's `send_file(..., as_attachment=True)` sets this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "119. **`hx-boost=\"false\"` for Downloads**: Opt out of AJAX for file download links. AJAX can't trigger browser's native save dialog — need normal link behavior. Inheritance means you must explicitly disable boost on download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "120. **CSS Transitions Don't Fire on Replacement**: Transitions animate property *changes* on existing elements. When htmx replaces an element entirely, there's nothing to transition *from* — the new element just appears at its final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "121. **htmx Settling Mechanism**: When swapping, htmx matches elements by `id`. For matched elements: (1) temporarily copies old element's attributes to new element, (2) swaps in new element, (3) after short delay, restores new element's actual attributes. This creates an attribute *change* that CSS can transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "122. **Stable ID Requirement**: For settling/smooth transitions to work, element needs the **same** `id` in both old and new HTML. Template produces same ID each time; only dynamic values (like width percentage) change.\n",
    "\n",
    "123. **Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting**: Scripting is acceptable in HDAs when it *enhances* rather than *replaces* hypermedia. Example: `_=\"on load click() me\"` (hyperscript) auto-clicks a download link — but the link still works without JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "124. **HTML Entities**: `&downarrow;` → ↓, `&amp;` → &, `&lt;` → <, `&copy;` → ©. Insert special characters in HTML. Purely visual — no functional meaning to browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "125. **Flask Context Processors**: `@app.context_processor` decorator lets you inject variables into all templates automatically, avoiding repetitive parameter passing in every route handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "126. **Markdown Soup**: Using Markdown elements for their *appearance* rather than semantic *meaning* (e.g., `_text_` for italics when `<cite>` is semantically correct for titles). Prefer embedded HTML or Markdown extensions when semantics matter.\n",

    "**New from \"Tricks Of The Htmx Masters\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "127. **`hx-swap` Modifiers Beyond Basics**:\n",
    "    - `settle`: Delay between content swap and attribute settling (for fine-grained CSS transitions)\n",
    "    - `show`: Scroll an element into viewport after request completes (e.g., `show:body:top` scrolls to page top)\n",
    "    - `scroll`: Scroll a scrollable element to top or bottom\n",
    "    - `focus-scroll`: Scroll to focused element (default false)\n",
    "\n",
    "128. **`delay` vs `throttle`**:\n",
    "    - `delay:200ms`: Resets timer on every event; fires only after silence (use for search-as-you-type)\n",
    "    - `throttle:200ms`: Fires immediately, then ignores events for interval (use for scroll/resize handlers)\n",
    "\n",
    "129. **Additional `hx-trigger` Modifiers**:\n",
    "    - `once`: Event triggers request only once ever\n",
    "    - `target`: Filter to events directly on a specific element (not bubbled)\n",
    "    - `consume`: Cancel event, prevent bubbling to ancestors\n",
    "    - `queue`: Control how events queue during in-flight requests (default keeps last event; can set to `none` to ignore all)\n",
    "\n",
    "130. **Trigger Filters**: JavaScript expression in square brackets evaluated on each event: `hx-trigger=\"click[contactRetrievalEnabled()]\"`. Request only proceeds if expression returns truthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "131. **`intersect` Synthetic Event**: More fine-grained than `revealed` — can specify threshold (e.g., trigger when 50% visible). Uses Intersection Observer API.\n",
    "\n",
    "132. **`hx-push-url`**: Pushes request URL into browser navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "133. **`hx-preserve`**: Keeps element unchanged during swaps — useful for preserving partially-filled forms or video players. Requires stable `id` to match elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "134. **`hx-sync`**: Synchronize requests between multiple elements. Prevents race conditions (e.g., user clicks \"Get Contacts\" then \"Get Settings\" — second request waits for first). Value `this` on parent element syncs all children.\n",
    "\n",
    "135. **`hx-disable`**: Disables all htmx behavior on element and children. Security feature — wrap user-generated content to prevent malicious htmx injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "136. **Events as \"Glue\"**: DOM is essentially an event bus. Events connect DOM, HTML, htmx, and scripting. Worth studying events in depth for advanced HDAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "137. **htmx-Emitted Events**:\n",
    "    - `htmx:load`: New content loaded into DOM\n",
    "    - `htmx:configRequest`: Before request — can modify or cancel\n",
    "    - `htmx:afterRequest`: After request completes\n",
    "    - `htmx:abort`: Send *to* an element to cancel in-flight request\n",
    "\n",
    "138. **`htmx:configRequest` for Global Request Modification**: Listen on `document.body`, modify `evt.detail.headers` or `evt.detail.parameters` to add auth tokens, custom headers, etc. to every htmx request.\n",
    "\n",
    "139. **`localStorage`**: Browser-side key-value storage that persists across sessions. Server cannot access directly — JavaScript must explicitly read and send it. Different from cookies (which are auto-sent with every request).\n",
    "\n",
    "140. **`detail` Property Convention**: Web standard for custom events — data goes in `detail` to avoid conflicts with native event properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "141. **`htmx:abort` Pattern**: Send this event to an htmx element to cancel its in-flight request. Useful for \"Cancel\" buttons on long-running operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "142. **Hyperscript for UI State**: `_=\"on htmx:beforeRequest remove @disabled from me\"` — enables Cancel button only while request is in flight. `@disabled` attribute grays out and prevents clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "143. **`HX-Trigger` Response Header**: Server can trigger client-side events by including event name in response header. Enables decoupled coordination — server announces \"contacts-updated\", interested elements listen and react.\n",
    "\n",
    "144. **Decoupled Coordination Pattern**: Button announces event, doesn't know/care who listens. Table listens on `body` (events bubble up). Elements can be moved, new listeners added — loose coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "145. **htmx Response Headers**:\n",
    "    - `HX-Location`: Client-side redirect\n",
    "    - `HX-Push-Url`: Push URL to location bar\n",
    "    - `HX-Refresh`: Refresh current page\n",
    "    - `HX-Retarget`: Change swap target on client side\n",
    "\n",
    "146. **Special Response Codes**:\n",
    "    - `204 No Content`: htmx skips swap entirely (even if response has body)\n",
    "    - `286`: Stops polling (for `hx-trigger=\"every Xs\"` requests)\n",
    "\n",
    "147. **`htmx:beforeSwap` Event**: Intercept before swap occurs. Can check `evt.detail.xhr.status` to handle error codes (e.g., show dialog on 404). Can also modify whether/where swap occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "148. **Three Approaches to \"Update Other Content\"**:\n",
    "    1. **Expand target** (simplest): Make target large enough to include everything that needs updating\n",
    "    2. **Out-of-band swaps**: Piggyback extra content in response with `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"`\n",
    "    3. **Server-triggered events**: Use `HX-Trigger` header for decoupled coordination (most flexible, most complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "149. **Out-of-Band Swaps**: Response includes elements with `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"` and matching `id`. htmx extracts these, swaps them by ID, then swaps remaining content into normal target. Enables updating multiple page areas from single response.\n",
    "\n",
    "150. **Complexity Budget**: htmx saves complexity on simple parts of app, freeing budget for genuinely complex features that may need reactive frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "151. **Debugging with `htmx.logAll()`**: Call in console or script to log all htmx internal events. Noisy but useful for understanding what's happening (or not happening).\n",
    "\n",
    "152. **Chrome `monitorEvents()`**: Console-only function to monitor all events on an element. Use `monitorEvents($0)` where `$0` is currently selected element in inspector. Useful for debugging event-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "153. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Browser security feature that restricts allowed scripts/sources. htmx works fine with most CSPs. Exception: disabling `eval()` breaks trigger filters (minor tradeoff).\n",
    "\n",
    "154. **htmx Configuration via Meta Tag**: `<meta name=\"htmx-config\" content='{\"defaultSwapStyle\":\"outerHTML\"}'>` — override defaults globally without JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "155. **Conformant HTML**: \"Semantic HTML\" is vague — better to think \"conformant HTML.\" Use elements for their specified purpose per the HTML spec, letting browsers and assistive tech extract meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Patterns from \"Tricks Of The Htmx Masters\"**:\n",
    "- **Global request modification**: `htmx:configRequest` listener adds headers/params to all requests\n",
    "- **Request cancellation**: Send `htmx:abort` to element to cancel in-flight request\n",
    "- **Server-triggered events**: `HX-Trigger` response header for decoupled updates\n",
    "- **Out-of-band swaps**: `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"` for multi-area updates from single response\n",
    "- **Request synchronization**: `hx-sync=\"this\"` on parent to prevent race conditions\n",

    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", \"More Htmx Patterns\", \"A Dynamic Archive UI\", and \"Tricks Of The Htmx Masters\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**: *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps. *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained (sessions/cookies technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off). *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability. *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation. *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed. *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**: *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources. *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly. *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself. *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering. Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**: `/contacts` — collection. `/contacts/new` — form to create. `/contacts/42` — single resource. `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit. `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**: Only anchors & forms can make requests. Only click/submit events trigger requests. Only GET & POST methods available. Only full page replacement possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default), `outerHTML`, `beforeend`, `afterbegin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**: *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET. *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs. *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: Converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Override with explicit values on specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted). Uniqueness validation *requires* server.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event, htmx requests server validation and updates error span.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger to only fire when input value actually changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs. Use sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Many UX patterns become variations on this theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments. Same fragment serves full page and htmx partial updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: `HX-Request`, `HX-Trigger`, `HX-Target`, `HX-Boosted`, `HX-Current-URL` automatically added.\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` to responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to a spinner element to show during requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests, place indicator *inside* target element — self-cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page → placeholder renders → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading improves *perceived* performance — users can interact immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives empty string, target element is removed from DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases: `htmx-swapping` class → swap delay → `htmx-settling` class → settle delay. Enables CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` gives CSS transitions time to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine swap delay with CSS transition on `htmx-swapping` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered, skip the redirect.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables returning partial HTML based on request context.\n",
    "\n",
    "106. **Long-Running Process Problem**: Blocking until complete = bad UX. Non-blocking with immediate response = better UX.\n",
    "\n",
    "107. **Common Async UI Patterns**: Email when complete, manual refresh, auto-refresh with JS timer.\n",
    "\n",
    "108. **Non-Blocking Design**: Server starts background job, responds immediately with progress UI. Client polls for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "109. **Polling**: Client repeatedly asks server \"are you done yet?\" at intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "110. **Fixed-Rate Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"every 3s\"` — polls indefinitely on a timer.\n",
    "\n",
    "111. **Load Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"load delay:500ms\"` — each response triggers the next request. Server controls continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "112. **Load Polling Chain**: Response includes trigger → element loads → fires request after delay → repeat. Omit trigger to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "113. **Same URL, Multiple Methods Pattern**: POST starts job; GET checks status; DELETE resets/cancels.\n",
    "\n",
    "114. **Single Template, Multiple States**: One template handles all UI states with Jinja `{% if %}` / `{% elif %}` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "115. **Archiver API Pattern**: `status()`, `progress()`, `run()`, `reset()`, `archive_file()`. Clean separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "116. **CSS Progress Bar**: Outer div (frame) + inner div (bar). Set inner div's `width` as percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "117. **ARIA for Custom Widgets**: `role=\"progressbar\"` and `aria-valuenow=\"50\"` make div-based progress bars accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "118. **File Downloads via HTTP**: `Content-Disposition: attachment` header tells browser to save response as file.\n",
    "\n",
    "119. **`hx-boost=\"false\"` for Downloads**: Opt out of AJAX for file download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "120. **CSS Transitions Don't Fire on Replacement**: Transitions animate property *changes* on existing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "121. **htmx Settling Mechanism**: htmx matches elements by `id`, copies old attributes, swaps, then restores new attributes — creating animatable change.\n",
    "\n",
    "122. **Stable ID Requirement**: For settling/smooth transitions, element needs the **same** `id` in both old and new HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "123. **Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting**: Scripting is acceptable when it *enhances* rather than *replaces* hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "124. **HTML Entities**: `&downarrow;` → ↓, `&amp;` → &, `&lt;` → <, `&copy;` → ©.\n",
    "\n",
    "125. **Flask Context Processors**: `@app.context_processor` injects variables into all templates automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "126. **Markdown Soup**: Using Markdown elements for *appearance* rather than semantic *meaning*. Prefer conformant HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "127. **`hx-swap` Modifiers Beyond Basics**: `settle` (delay before attribute settling), `show` (scroll element into viewport, e.g., `show:body:top`), `scroll` (scroll scrollable element to top/bottom), `focus-scroll` (scroll to focused element).\n",
    "\n",
    "128. **`delay` vs `throttle`**: `delay:200ms` resets timer on every event, fires after silence (search-as-you-type). `throttle:200ms` fires immediately, then ignores events for interval (scroll/resize handlers).\n",
    "\n",
    "129. **Additional `hx-trigger` Modifiers**: `once` (trigger only once), `target` (filter to events directly on specific element), `consume` (cancel event, prevent bubbling), `queue` (control event queuing during in-flight requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "130. **Trigger Filters**: JavaScript expression in square brackets evaluated on each event: `hx-trigger=\"click[contactRetrievalEnabled()]\"`. Request proceeds only if truthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "131. **`intersect` Synthetic Event**: More fine-grained than `revealed` — can specify threshold (e.g., trigger when 50% visible).\n",
    "\n",
    "132. **`hx-preserve`**: Keeps element unchanged during swaps — useful for preserving partially-filled forms or video players. Requires stable `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "133. **`hx-sync`**: Synchronize requests between multiple elements. Prevents race conditions. Value `this` on parent syncs all children.\n",
    "\n",
    "134. **`hx-disable`**: Disables all htmx behavior on element and children. Security feature for user-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "135. **Events as \"Glue\"**: DOM is essentially an event bus. Events connect DOM, HTML, htmx, and scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "136. **htmx-Emitted Events**: `htmx:load` (content loaded), `htmx:configRequest` (before request — can modify/cancel), `htmx:afterRequest` (after completion), `htmx:abort` (send to element to cancel in-flight request).\n",
    "\n",
    "137. **`htmx:configRequest` for Global Request Modification**: Listen on `document.body`, modify `evt.detail.headers` or `evt.detail.parameters` to add auth tokens to every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "138. **`localStorage`**: Browser-side key-value storage that persists across sessions. Server cannot access directly — JavaScript must explicitly read and send it. Different from cookies (auto-sent with every request).\n",
    "\n",
    "139. **`detail` Property Convention**: Web standard for custom events — data goes in `detail` to avoid conflicts with native event properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "140. **`htmx:abort` Pattern**: Send this event to an htmx element to cancel its in-flight request. Useful for \"Cancel\" buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "141. **Hyperscript for UI State**: `_=\"on htmx:beforeRequest remove @disabled from me\"` — enables Cancel button only while request is in flight. `@disabled` grays out and prevents clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "142. **`HX-Trigger` Response Header**: Server can trigger client-side events by including event name in response header. Enables decoupled coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "143. **Decoupled Coordination Pattern**: Button announces event, doesn't know who listens. Table listens on `body` (events bubble up). Loose coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "144. **htmx Response Headers**: `HX-Location` (client-side redirect), `HX-Push-Url` (push URL to location bar), `HX-Refresh` (refresh page), `HX-Retarget` (change swap target).\n",
    "\n",
    "145. **Special Response Codes**: `204 No Content` (htmx skips swap entirely), `286` (stops polling).\n",
    "\n",
    "146. **`htmx:beforeSwap` Event**: Intercept before swap. Can check `evt.detail.xhr.status` to handle error codes. Can modify whether/where swap occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "147. **Three Approaches to \"Update Other Content\"**: (1) **Expand target** (simplest): Make target large enough. (2) **Out-of-band swaps**: Piggyback extra content with `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"`. (3) **Server-triggered events**: Use `HX-Trigger` header (most flexible, most complex).\n",
    "\n",
    "148. **Out-of-Band Swaps**: Response includes elements with `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"` and matching `id`. htmx extracts these, swaps by ID, then swaps remaining content into normal target.\n",
    "\n",
    "149. **Complexity Budget**: htmx saves complexity on simple parts, freeing budget for genuinely complex features.\n",
    "\n",
    "150. **Debugging with `htmx.logAll()`**: Call in console or script to log all htmx internal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "151. **Chrome `monitorEvents()`**: Console-only function to monitor all events on an element. Use `monitorEvents($0)` for currently selected element.\n",
    "\n",
    "152. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Browser security feature restricting allowed scripts/sources. htmx works with most CSPs. Exception: disabling `eval()` breaks trigger filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "153. **htmx Configuration via Meta Tag**: `<meta name=\"htmx-config\" content='{\"defaultSwapStyle\":\"outerHTML\"}'>` — override defaults globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "154. **Conformant HTML**: Use elements for their specified purpose per the HTML spec, letting browsers and assistive tech extract meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where We're Headed**: The next chapter covers \"Client Side Scripting.\""
