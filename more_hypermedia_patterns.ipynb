    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", and \"Htmx Patterns\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: A \"magic\" attribute that converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app. Swaps only `<body>` content, preserving `<head>` (scripts, styles already loaded). Avoids Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). History, back button, deep links still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout. Page-load JavaScript and third-party widgets may need adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Place `hx-boost=\"true\"` on parent, children inherit. Override with `hx-boost=\"false\"` on specific elements (e.g., file downloads that need normal browser behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally. Not all htmx features offer this; developer must decide if supporting no-JS users is worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception — too useful to exclude despite being implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed. The button itself becomes a standalone hypermedia control. Combined with `hx-target=\"body\"` and `hx-push-url=\"true\"` for correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Code 303 explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\" Prevents browser from repeating the DELETE on the redirected URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()` — not styleable, but zero additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers — added complexity the book skips for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted — always re-validate server-side). Uniqueness validation *requires* server — only the database knows if email exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event (default for inputs), htmx requests server validation and updates error span with response. Partial update — only the error message changes, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included. Sibling form data requires `hx-include` for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types. But firing on every keystroke wastes server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses before sending request. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger (`keyup delay:200ms changed`) to only fire when input value actually changes — ignores arrow keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice. Plain HTML anchor tags work; `hx-boost` makes them AJAX-powered automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`. Server returns full page; htmx extracts just the rows (including new \"Load More\" button for next page). No server-side changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping. Useful when server returns full page but you only want a fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click. `revealed` is a synthetic htmx event fired when element enters viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs — can't bookmark or share \"modal open\" state. Use sparingly (alerts, confirmations); prefer inline editing or separate pages for domain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually. Use \"visually hidden\" CSS pattern if element should remain accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Patterns Demonstrated in \"Htmx Patterns\"**:\n",
    "- Partial updates (validation errors) vs full body swaps (boosted navigation)\n",
    "- Server returns what it normally would; htmx attributes control extraction and placement\n",
    "- Declarative attributes replace JavaScript for common UX patterns\n",
    "- Same server endpoint can serve multiple UX patterns (paging vs click-to-load vs infinite scroll)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Active Search\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good with Contact.app: we have a nice little web application with some significant improvements over a plain HTML-based application. We’ve added a proper “Delete Contact” button, done some dynamic validation of input and looked at different approaches to add paging to the application. As we have said, many web developers would expect that a lot of JavaScript-based scripting would be required to get these features, but we’ve done it all in relatively pure HTML, using only htmx attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We _will_ eventually add some client-side scripting to our application: hypermedia is powerful, but it isn’t _all powerful_ and sometimes scripting might be the best (or only) way to achieve a given goal. For now, however, let’s see what we can accomplish with hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first advanced htmx feature we will create is known as the “Active Search” pattern. Active Search is when, as a user types text into a search box, the results of that search are dynamically shown. This pattern was made popular when Google adopted it for search results, and many applications now implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement Active Search, we are going to use techniques closely related to the way we did email validation in the previous chapter. If you think about it, the two features are similar in many ways: in both cases we want to issue a request as the user types into an input and then update some other element with a response. The server-side implementations will, of course, be very different, but the frontend code will look fairly similar due to htmx’s general approach of “issue a request on an event and replace something on the screen.”\n",

And as the author hints we are going to use something similar to what we did for the email of our vision. and we also talk about how we've been able to accomplish most of this by using HTML and HTML style implementation as opposed to as one might suspect a JavaScript heavy client side scripting. though it seems like there will be some features that will require scripting and that might Maybe something in the future that will be discussed.

    "\n",
    "**The pattern generalization** — Notice how the authors frame this: email validation and active search are *conceptually the same* from htmx's perspective. Different server logic, same client-side pattern: trigger on user input → request → swap response into DOM. This is a powerful way to think — once you internalize \"event → request → swap,\" many UX patterns become variations on a theme rather than separate problems requiring separate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast with SPA thinking** — In a typical SPA, \"active search\" would likely involve: a debounced state variable, an effect hook watching that state, a loading state, an error state, storing results in state, and a component that renders based on all that state. Here, it's just... attributes on HTML elements. The server does the work, returns HTML, and htmx puts it where you told it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The scripting foreshadowing** — The authors are being honest that hypermedia isn't a silver bullet. When scripting *does* appear later, pay attention to *what kind* of problem requires it — that'll help you build intuition for where the hypermedia approach's boundaries are.\n",

The main functionality of the feature is provided by the second triggering event, the `keyup`.

As things currently stand, an HTTP `GET` request will be issued to the `/contacts` path, which will, as of now, return an entire HTML document of search results, and then this whole document will be inserted into the _inner_ HTML of the search input.\n",

If you submit two searches and want to go back to the first one, you can simply hit back and the browser will “return” to that search.\n",

Fortunately, we’ve already seen how to fix this: with the `hx-push-url` attribute.\n",

    "A final touch for our Active Search pattern is to add a request indicator to let the user know that a search is in progress. As it stands the user has no explicit signal that the active search functionality is handling a request. If the search takes a bit, a user may end up thinking that the feature isn’t working. By adding a request indicator we let the user know that the hypermedia application is busy and they should wait (hopefully not too long!) for the request to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Htmx provides support for request indicators via the `hx-indicator` attribute. This attribute takes, you guessed it, a CSS selector that points to the indicator for a given element. The indicator can be anything, but it is typically some sort of animated image, such as a gif or svg file, that spins or otherwise communicates visually that “something is happening.”\n",

    "\n",
    "It just works, but how does htmx make the spinner appear and disappear? Note that the indicator `img` tag has the `htmx-indicator` class on it. `htmx-indicator` is a CSS class that is automatically injected into the page by htmx. This class sets the default `opacity` of an element to `0`, which hides the element from view, while at the same time not disrupting the layout of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an htmx request is triggered that points to this indicator, another class, `htmx-request` is added to the indicator which transitions its opacity to 1. So you can use just about anything as an indicator, and it will be hidden by default. Then, when a request is in flight, it will be shown. This is all done via standard CSS classes, allowing you to control the transitions and even the mechanism by which the indicator is shown (e.g., you might use `display` rather than `opacity`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Request Indicators!**\n",

Requests might seem instant when you are working on your application locally, but in the real world they can take quite a bit longer due to network latency. It’s often a good idea to take advantage of browser developer tools that allow you to throttle your local browser’s response times. This will give you a better idea of what real world users are seeing, and show you where indicators might help users understand exactly what is going on.\n",

    "A shortcoming of the current implementation is that currently there is no indication that the count request is in flight, it just appears at some point when the request finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t ideal. What we want here is an indicator, just like we added in our Active Search example. And, in fact, we can simply reuse that same exact spinner image, copy-and-pasted into the new HTML we have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in this case, we have a one-time request and, once the request is over, we are not going to need the spinner anymore. So it doesn’t make sense to use the exact same approach we did with the active search example. Recall that in that case we placed a spinner _after_ the span and using the `hx-indicator` attribute to point to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since the spinner is only used once, we can put it _inside_ the content of the span. When the request completes the content in the response will be placed inside the span, replacing the spinner with the computed contact count. It turns out that htmx allows you to place indicators with the `htmx-indicator` class on them inside of elements that issue htmx-powered requests. In the absence of an `hx-indicator` attribute, these internal indicators will be shown when a request is in flight.\n",

    "### The Htmx Swapping Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pretty cool, but there is another improvement we can make if we take some time to understand the htmx content swapping model: it would be nice if, rather than just instantly deleting the row, we faded it out before we removed it. The fade would make it clear that the row is being removed, giving the user some nice visual feedback on the deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out we can do this pretty easily with htmx, but to do so we’ll need to dig in to exactly how htmx swaps content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that htmx simply puts the new content into the DOM, but that’s not in fact how it works. Instead, content goes through a series of steps as it is added to the DOM:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When content is received and about to be swapped into the DOM, the `htmx-swapping` CSS class is added to the target element.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A small delay then occurs (we will discuss why this delay exists in a moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Next, the `htmx-swapping` class is removed from the target and the `htmx-settling` class is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The new content is swapped into the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Another small delay occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Finally, the `htmx-settling` class is removed from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to the swap mechanic (settling, for example, is a more advanced topic that we will discuss in a later chapter) but this is enough for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are small delays in the process here, typically on the order of a few milliseconds. Why so? It turns out that these small delays allow _CSS transitions_ to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSS Transitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS transitions are a technology that allow you to animate a transition from one style to another. So, for example, if you changed the height of something from 10 pixels to 20 pixels, by using a CSS transition you can make the element smoothly animate to the new height. These sorts of animations are fun, often increase application usability, and are a great mechanism to add polish to your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, CSS transitions are difficult to access in plain HTML: you usually have to use JavaScript and add or remove classes to get them to trigger. This is why the htmx swap model is more complicated than you might initially think. By swapping in classes and adding small delays, you can access CSS transitions purely within HTML, without needing to write any JavaScript!\n",

    "### Taking Advantage of “htmx-swapping”\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so, let’s go back and look at our inline delete mechanic: we click an htmx-enhanced link which deletes the contact and then swaps some empty content in for the row. We know that before the `tr` element is removed, it will have the `htmx-swapping` class added to it. We can take advantage of that to write a CSS transition that fades the opacity of the row to 0. Here is what that CSS looks like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    tr.htmx-swapping { <1>\n",
    "      opacity: 0; <2>\n",
    "      transition: opacity 1s ease-out; <3>\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a fade out transition\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. We want this style to apply to `tr` elements with the `htmx-swapping` class on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. The `opacity` will be 0, making it invisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. The `opacity` will transition to 0 over a 1 second time period, using the `ease-out` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is not a CSS book and we are not going to go deeply into the details of CSS transitions, but hopefully the above makes sense to you, even if this is the first time you’ve seen CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, think about what this means from the htmx swapping model: when htmx gets content back to swap into the row it will put the `htmx-swapping` class on the row and wait a bit. This will allow the transition to a zero opacity to occur, fading the row out. Then the new (empty) content will be swapped in, which will effectively remove the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds good, and we are nearly there. There is one more thing we need to do: the default “swap delay” for htmx is very short, a few milliseconds. That makes sense in most cases: you don’t want to have much of a delay before you put the new content into the DOM. But, in this case, we want to give the CSS animation time to complete before we do the swap, we want to give it a second, in fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately htmx has an option for the `hx-swap` annotation that allows you to set the swap delay: following the swap type you can add `swap:` followed by a timing value to tell htmx to wait a specific amount of time before it swaps. Let’s update our HTML to allow a one second delay before the swap is done for the delete action:\n",
    "    \n",

    "      <a href=\"/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit\">Edit</a>\n",

    "        hx-confirm=\"Are you sure you want to delete this contact?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this modification, the existing row will stay in the DOM for an additional second, with the `htmx-swapping` class on it. This will give the row time to transition to an opacity of zero, giving the fade out effect we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a user clicks on a “Delete” link and confirms the delete, the row will slowly fade out and then, once it has faded to a 0 opacity, it will be removed. Pretty fancy, and all done in a declarative, hypermedia-oriented manner, no JavaScript required.

    "  4. Delete the given contact with each id.\n",

    "\n",

    "So, we took the original delete logic and slightly modified it to deal with an array of ids, rather than a single id.\n",

    "You might notice one other small change: we did away with the redirect that was in the original delete code. We did so because we are already on the page we want to re-render, so there is no reason to redirect and have the URL update to something new. We can just re-render the page, and the new list of contacts (sans the contacts that were deleted) will be re-rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there we go, we now have a bulk delete feature for our application. Once again, not a huge amount of code, and we are implementing these features entirely by exchanging hypermedia with a server in the traditional, RESTful manner of the web.\n",

    "That makes sense. the server side logic seems straightforward enough. and it also makes sense that we are re-rendering the same index.html with the updated context set contacts set and we're not redirecting because before when we were we were in an individual delete table, individual contact, and after deleting we would go back to the contact list, but that case is not the same here. we're already in the contact list page. Is that correct? And, author highlights how we have been able to accomplish an interesting feature with staying true to the hypermedia application.

    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", and \"More Htmx Patterns\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: A \"magic\" attribute that converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app. Swaps only `<body>` content, preserving `<head>` (scripts, styles already loaded). Avoids Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). History, back button, deep links still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout. Page-load JavaScript and third-party widgets may need adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Place `hx-boost=\"true\"` on parent, children inherit. Override with `hx-boost=\"false\"` on specific elements (e.g., file downloads that need normal browser behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally. Not all htmx features offer this; developer must decide if supporting no-JS users is worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception — too useful to exclude despite being implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed. The button itself becomes a standalone hypermedia control. Combined with `hx-target=\"body\"` and `hx-push-url=\"true\"` for correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Code 303 explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\" Prevents browser from repeating the DELETE on the redirected URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()` — not styleable, but zero additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers — added complexity the book skips for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted — always re-validate server-side). Uniqueness validation *requires* server — only the database knows if email exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event (default for inputs), htmx requests server validation and updates error span with response. Partial update — only the error message changes, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included. Sibling form data requires `hx-include` for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types. But firing on every keystroke wastes server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses before sending request. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger (`keyup delay:200ms changed`) to only fire when input value actually changes — ignores arrow keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice. Plain HTML anchor tags work; `hx-boost` makes them AJAX-powered automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`. Server returns full page; htmx extracts just the rows (including new \"Load More\" button for next page). No server-side changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping. Useful when server returns full page but you only want a fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click. `revealed` is a synthetic htmx event fired when element enters viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs — can't bookmark or share \"modal open\" state. Use sparingly (alerts, confirmations); prefer inline editing or separate pages for domain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually. Use \"visually hidden\" CSS pattern if element should remain accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Once internalized, many UX patterns become variations on this theme rather than separate problems. Active search, email validation, lazy loading — all follow the same pattern with different triggers, targets, and endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input. Issues request as user types (debounced), updates results without full page reload. Nearly identical to email validation pattern — same client-side approach, different server logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter. Combined with `keyup` for comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments (e.g., `rows.html` extracted from `index.html`). The same fragment serves two purposes: included in full page for normal requests, rendered alone for htmx partial updates. Central to htmx development.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position. Enables template factoring while keeping full-page rendering intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: htmx automatically adds headers to every request:\n",
    "    - `HX-Request`: Always \"true\" for htmx requests\n",
    "    - `HX-Trigger`: The `id` of the element that triggered the request\n",
    "    - `HX-Target`: The `id` of the target element\n",
    "    - `HX-Boosted`: \"true\" if request came from `hx-boost`\n",
    "    - `HX-Current-URL`: Browser's current URL\n",
    "    - Others: `HX-Prompt`, `HX-History-Restore-Request`, `HX-Trigger-Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks `request.headers.get('HX-Trigger')` to determine which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content (full page vs fragment) based on context. More specific than just checking `HX-Request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens a bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx involved — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page. This is why checking `HX-Trigger` (not just `HX-Request`) ensures bookmarks work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` (or relevant header) to responses. Tells caches (CDNs, proxies) to cache responses separately based on that header. Prevents serving partial HTML to regular browser requests from cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Adding `hx-push-url=\"true\"` updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button. Trade-off: each debounced keystroke creates a history entry, which may clutter browser history.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to an element (typically a spinner) to show during requests. The indicator element needs class `htmx-indicator`, which htmx auto-injects with `opacity: 0`. During requests, htmx adds `htmx-request` class, transitioning opacity to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests (like lazy loading), place the indicator *inside* the target element. When response arrives, it replaces the indicator via `innerHTML` — self-cleaning, no cleanup needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks (e.g., \"Slow 3G\"). Reveals UX issues with loading states that aren't visible on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast; expensive content loads separately. User can interact immediately while waiting content loads in background.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM. Used for lazy loading — request fires immediately when element appears on page.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport (uses Intersection Observer API internally). Makes lazy loading \"truly lazy\" — request only fires when user actually sees the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript. htmx provides these to enable patterns that would otherwise require custom JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page request → page renders with empty placeholder → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder. The secondary request *cannot* return before the main page because it's triggered by the element existing in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading may not reduce *total* load time (may even increase it slightly due to extra request). But *perceived* performance improves because users can interact immediately rather than staring at a blank screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link in a table row. Deletes contact and removes just that row, not the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives an empty string response, the target element is removed from DOM. Simple but powerful pattern for deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header. Server checks: if `HX-Trigger == 'delete-btn'`, redirect to list page; otherwise return empty string to remove row inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases during swap:\n",
    "    1. `htmx-swapping` class added to target\n",
    "    2. Brief pause (swap delay)\n",
    "    3. Class changes to `htmx-settling`, content swapped in\n",
    "    4. Brief pause (settle delay)\n",
    "    5. `htmx-settling` class removed\n",
    "    The pauses enable CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes to animate swaps. htmx adds/removes classes automatically — you just define what those classes look like (e.g., `opacity: 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` tells htmx to wait 1 second before swapping. Gives CSS transitions time to complete. Match the delay to your CSS transition duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` with CSS `tr.htmx-swapping { opacity: 0; transition: opacity 1s ease-out; }`. Row fades out, then is removed. No JavaScript required.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute to each row. Button uses `hx-delete` targeting the collection URL. htmx auto-includes all checked values for non-GET requests when inside a form.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list. Access via `request.form.getlist('name')` or `request.args.getlist('name')` in Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered (e.g., bulk delete from contact list), skip the redirect — just re-render the template directly. Redirect is only needed when navigating to a different view.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables optimizations like returning partial HTML based on request context. When using third-party APIs, fall back to `hx-select` for client-side filtering.\n",
    "\n",

    "## HTML Notes: Accessible by Default?\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility problems can arise when we try to implement controls that aren’t built into HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, in Chapter 1, we looked at the example of a <div> improvised to work like a button. Let’s look at a different example: what if you make something that looks like a set of tabs, but you use radio buttons and CSS hacks to build it? It’s a neat hack that makes the rounds in web development communities from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that tabs have requirements beyond clicking to change content. Your improvised tabs may be missing features that will lead to user confusion and frustration, as well as some undesirable behaviors. From the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide on tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Keyboard interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Can the tabs be focused with the Tab key?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ARIA roles, states, and properties\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “[The element that contains the tabs] has role `tablist`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “Each [tab] has role `tab` […​]”\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “Each element that contains the content panel for a `tab` has role `tabpanel`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “Each [tab] has the property `aria-controls` referring to its associated tabpanel element.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “The active `tab` element has the state `aria-selected` set to `true` and all other `tab` elements have it set to `false`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    * “Each element with role `tabpanel` has the property `aria-labelledby` referring to its associated `tab` element.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You would need to write a lot of code to make your improvised tabs fulfill all of these requirements. Some of the ARIA attributes can be added directly in HTML, but they are repetitive and others (like `aria-selected`) need to be set through JavaScript since they are dynamic. The keyboard interactions can be error-prone too.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not impossible, not even that hard, to make your own tab set implementation. However, it’s difficult to trust that a new implementation will work for all users in all environments, since most of us have limited resources for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stick with established libraries_ for UI interactions. If a use case requires a bespoke solution, _test exhaustively_ for keyboard interaction and accessibility. Test manually. Test automatically. Test with screen readers, test with a keyboard, test on different browsers and hardware, and run linters (while coding and/or in CI). Testing is critical to ensure machine readability, or human readability, or page weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider: Does the information need to be presented as tabs? Sometimes the answer is yes, but if not, a sequence of details and disclosures fulfills a very similar purpose.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <details><summary>Disclosure 1</summary>\n",
    "      Disclosure 1 contents\n",

    "      Disclosure 2 contents\n",
    "    </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compromising UX just to avoid JavaScript is bad development. But sometimes it’s possible to achieve an equal (or better!) quality of UX while allowing for a simpler and more robust implementation by changing the design.\n",
