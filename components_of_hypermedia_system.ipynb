    "Overall summary upto this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Covered**: \"Upto Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",

    "### The Hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental technology of a hypermedia system is a hypermedia that allows a client and server to communicate with one another in a dynamic, non-linear fashion. Again, what makes a hypermedia a hypermedia is the presence of _hypermedia controls_ : elements that allow users to select non-linear actions within the hypermedia. Users can _interact_ with the media in a manner beyond simply reading from start to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already mentioned the two primary hypermedia controls in HTML, anchors and forms, which allow a browser to present links and operations to a user through a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of HTML, these links and forms typically specify the target of their operations using _Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)_ :\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Resource Locator\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform resource locator is a textual string that refers to, or _points to_ a location on a network where a _resource_ can be retrieved from, as well as the mechanism by which the resource can be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A URL is a string consisting of various subcomponents:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    [scheme]://[userinfo]@[host]:[port][path]?[query]#[fragment]\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "URL Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these subcomponents are not required, and are often omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical URL might look like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple URL\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular URL is made up of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A protocol or scheme (in this case, `https`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A domain (e.g., `hypermedia.systems`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A path (e.g., `/book/contents`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This URL uniquely identifies a retrievable _resource_ on the internet, to which an _HTTP Request_ can be issued by a hypermedia client that “speaks” HTTPS, such as a web browser. If this URL is found as the reference of a hypermedia control within an HTML document, it implies that there is a _hypermedia server_ on the other side of the network that understands HTTPS as well, and that can respond to this request with a _representation_ of the given resource (or redirect you to another location, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that URLs are often not written out entirely within HTML. It is very common to see anchor tags that look like this, for example:\n",

    "    <a href=\"/book/contents/\">Table Of Contents</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Simple Link\n",

    "Here we have a _relative_ hypermedia reference, where the protocol, host and port are _implied_ to be that of the “current document,” that is, the same as whatever the protocol and server were to retrieve the current HTML page. So, if this link was found in an HTML document retrieved from `https://hypermedia.systems/`, then the implied URL for this anchor would be `https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/`.\n",

    "\n",
    "`GET`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A GET request retrieves the representation of the specified resource. GET requests should not mutate data.\n",

    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A PUT request replaces the data of the specified resource. This results in a mutation of state on the server.\n",

    "\n",
    "A PATCH request replaces the data of the specified resource. This results in a mutation of state on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A DELETE request deletes the specified resource. This results in a mutation of state on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods _roughly_ line up with the “Create/Read/Update/Delete” or CRUD pattern found in many applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `POST` corresponds with Creating a resource.\n",

    "  * `GET` corresponds with Reading a resource.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the enclosed representation according to the resource’s own semantics, whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as replacing the state of the target resource. Hence, the intent of PUT is idempotent and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server.\n",

    "\n",
    "In plain terms, a `POST` can be handled by a server pretty much however it likes, whereas a `PUT` should be handled as a “replacement” of the resource, although the language, once again allows the server to do pretty much whatever it would like within the constraint of being [_idempotent_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a properly structured HTML-based hypermedia system you would use an appropriate HTTP method for the operation a particular hypermedia control performs. For example, if a hypermedia control such as a button _deletes_ a resource, ideally it should issue an HTTP `DELETE` request to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strange thing about HTML, though, is that the native hypermedia controls can only issue HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor tags always issue a `GET` request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms can issue either a `GET` or `POST` using the `method` attribute.\n",

Since a `POST` can do almost anything, it ends up being used for any mutation on the server, and `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` are left aside in plain HTML-based applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The cache behavior of an HTTP response from a server can be indicated with the `Cache-Control` response header. This header can have a number of different values indicating the cacheability of a given response. If, for example, the header contains the value `max-age=60`, this indicates that a client may cache this response for 60 seconds, and need not issue another HTTP request for that resource until that time limit has expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important caching-related response header is `Vary`. This response header can be used to indicate exactly what headers in an HTTP Request form the unique identifier for a cached result. This becomes important to allow the browser to correctly cache content in situations where a particular header affects the form of the server response.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern in htmx-powered applications, for example, is to use a custom header set by htmx, `HX-Request`, to differentiate between “normal” web requests and requests submitted by htmx.

    "\n",
    "Hypermedia servers are any server that can respond to an HTTP request with an HTTP response. Because HTTP is so simple, this means that nearly any programming language can be used to build a hypermedia server. There are a vast number of libraries available for building HTTP-based hypermedia servers in nearly every programming language imaginable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be one of the best aspects of adopting hypermedia as your primary technology for building a web application: it removes the pressure to adopt JavaScript as a backend technology. If you use a JavaScript-heavy Single Page Application-based front end, and you use JSON Data APIs, you are going to feel significant pressure to deploy JavaScript on the back end as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this latter situation, you already have a ton of code written in JavaScript. Why maintain two separate code bases in two different languages? Why not create reusable domain logic on the client-side as well as the server-side? Now that JavaScript has excellent server-side technologies available like Node and Deno, why not just use a single language for everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, building a Hypermedia-Driven Application gives you a lot more freedom in picking the back end technology you want to use. Your decision can be based on the domain of your application, what languages and server software you are familiar with or are passionate about, or just what you feel like trying out.\n",
    "\n",
    "You certainly aren’t writing your server-side logic in HTML! And every major programming language has at least one good web framework and templating library that can be used to handle HTTP requests cleanly.\n",

    "If you are doing something in big data, perhaps you’d like to use Python, which has tremendous support for that domain.\n",

    "### Hypermedia Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "We now come to the final major component in a hypermedia system: the hypermedia client. Hypermedia _clients_ are software that understand how to interpret a particular hypermedia, and the hypermedia controls within it, properly. The canonical example, of course, is the web browser, which understands HTML and can present it to a user to interact with. Web browsers are incredibly sophisticated pieces of software. (So sophisticated, in fact, that they are often re-purposed away from being a hypermedia client, to being a sort of cross-platform virtual machine for launching Single Page Applications.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers aren’t the only hypermedia clients out there, however. In the last section of this book we will look at Hyperview, a mobile-oriented hypermedia. One of the outstanding features of Hyperview is that it doesn’t simply provide a hypermedia, HXML, but also provides a _working hypermedia client_ for that hypermedia. This makes building a proper Hypermedia-Driven Application with Hyperview extremely easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial feature of a hypermedia system is what is known as _the uniform interface_. We discuss this concept in depth in the next section on REST. What is often ignored in discussions about hypermedia is how important the hypermedia client is in taking advantage of this uniform interface. A hypermedia client must know how to properly interpret and present hypermedia controls found in a hypermedia response from a hypermedia server for the whole hypermedia system to hang together. Without a sophisticated client that can do this, hypermedia controls and a hypermedia-based API are much less useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one reason why JSON APIs have rarely adopted hypermedia controls successfully: JSON APIs are typically consumed by code that is expecting a fixed format and that isn’t designed to be a hypermedia client. This is totally understandable: building a good hypermedia client is hard! For JSON API clients like this, the power of hypermedia controls embedded within an API response is irrelevant and often simply annoying:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The short answer to this question is that HATEOAS isn’t a good fit for most modern use cases for APIs. That is why after almost 20 years, HATEOAS still hasn’t gained wide adoption among developers. GraphQL on the other hand is spreading like wildfire because it solves real-world problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have reviewed the major components of a hypermedia system, it’s time to look more deeply into the concept of REST. The term “REST” comes from Roy Fielding’s PhD dissertation on the architecture of the web. Fielding wrote his dissertation at U.C. Irvine, after having helped build much of the infrastructure of the early web, including the Apache web server. Roy was attempting to formalize and describe the novel distributed computing system that he had helped to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to focus on what we feel is the most important section of Fielding’s writing, from a web development perspective: Section 5.1. This section contains the core concepts (Fielding calls them _constraints_) of Representational State Transfer, or REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the muck, however, it is important to understand that Fielding discusses REST as a _network architecture_ , that is, as an entirely different way to architect a distributed system. And, further, as a novel network architecture that should be _contrasted_ with earlier approaches to distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to emphasize that, at the time Fielding wrote his dissertation, JSON APIs and AJAX did not exist. He was describing the early web, with HTML being transferred over HTTP by early browsers, as a hypermedia system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, in a strange turn of events, the term “REST” is mainly associated with JSON Data APIs, rather than with HTML and hypermedia. This is extremely funny once you realize that the vast majority of JSON Data APIs aren’t RESTful, in the original sense, and, in fact, _can’t_ be RESTful, since they aren’t using a natural hypermedia format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-emphasize: REST, as coined by Fielding, describes the _pre-API web_ , and letting go of the current, common usage of the term REST to simply mean “a JSON API” is necessary to develop a proper understanding of the idea.\n",

Given a bit of time thinking about the constraints he outlines and some concrete examples of those constraints it will become easy to assess whether a given system actually satisfies the architectural requirements of REST or not.\n",

    "  * It is a client-server architecture (section 5.1.2).\n",

    "  * It must be stateless; (section 5.1.3) that is, every request contains all information necessary to respond to that request.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It must allow for caching (section 5.1.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It must have a _uniform interface_ (section 5.1.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It is a layered system (section 5.1.6).\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, for many web applications today, we actually violate this constraint: it is common to establish a _session cookie_ that acts as a unique identifier for a given user and that is sent along with every request. While this session cookie is, by itself, not stateful (it is sent with every request), it is typically used as a key to look up information stored on the server, in what is usually termed “the session.”\n",

    "This violation of the Statelessness REST architectural constraint has proven to be useful for building web applications and does not appear to have had a major impact on the overall flexibility of the web. But it is worth bearing in mind that even Web 1.0 applications often violate the purity of REST in the interest of pragmatic trade-offs.\n",

The HTML representation of the contact _encodes_ the state of the application; it encodes exactly what can and cannot be done with this particular representation, in a way that the JSON representation does not.\n",

    "A client interpreting the JSON response must, again, understand not only the general concept of a Contact, but also specifically what the “status” field with the value “Archived” means. It must know exactly what operations are available on an “Archived” contact, to appropriately display them to an end user. The state of the application is not encoded in the response, but rather conveyed through a mix of raw data and side channel information such as API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in the majority of front end SPA frameworks today, this contact information would live _in memory_ in a JavaScript object representing a model of the contact, while the page data is held in the browser’s [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (DOM). The DOM would be updated based on changes to this model, that is, the DOM would “react” to changes to this backing JavaScript model.\n",

    "With the HTML approach, the Hypermedia is, indeed, The Engine Of Application State: there is no additional model on the client side, and all state is expressed directly in the hypermedia, in this case HTML. As state changes on the server, it is reflected in the representation (that is, HTML) sent back to the client. The hypermedia client (a browser) doesn’t know anything about contacts, what the concept of “Archiving” is, or anything else about the particular domain model for this response: it simply knows how to render HTML.\n",

    "### An Optional Constraint: Code-On-Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "We called The Layered System constraint the final “required” constraint because Fielding mentions one additional constraint on a RESTful system. This Code On Demand constraint is somewhat awkwardly described as “optional” (Section 5.1.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, Fielding says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after deployment improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional constraint within REST.\n",
    "\n",
    " Roy Fielding, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "So, scripting was and is a native aspect of the original RESTful model of the web, and thus should of course be allowed in a Hypermedia-Driven Application.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in a Hypermedia-Driven Application the presence of scripting should _not_ change the fundamental networking model: hypermedia should continue to be the engine of application state, server communication should still consist of hypermedia exchanges rather than, for example, JSON data exchanges, and so on. (JSON Data API’s certainly have their place; in Chapter 10 we’ll discuss when and how to use them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, unfortunately, the scripting layer of the web, JavaScript, is quite often used to _replace_ , rather than augment the hypermedia model. We will elaborate in a later chapter what scripting that does not replace the underlying hypermedia system of the web looks like.\n",

    "**Chapter Covered**: \"Components of a Hypermedia System\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",

    "11. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\" and \"Components of a Hypermedia System\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
