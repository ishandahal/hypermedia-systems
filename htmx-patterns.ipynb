    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", and \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps\n",
    "    - *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained. Sessions (cookies) technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off\n",
    "    - *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability\n",
    "    - *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation (see below)\n",
    "    - *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed\n",
    "    - *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**:\n",
    "    - *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources\n",
    "    - *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly\n",
    "    - *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself\n",
    "    - *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form. The browser's history tracks the *final destination* (the GET), not the POST — so refresh re-runs the harmless GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: \n",
    "    - Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering (after the `?`)\n",
    "    - Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources (in the URL structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages. No JavaScript needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**:\n",
    "    - `/contacts` — collection\n",
    "    - `/contacts/new` — form to create\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42` — single resource\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit\n",
    "    - `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort. More RESTful than most JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets. Simpler but less isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state. It works but doesn't feel modern.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**:\n",
    "    - Only anchors & forms can make requests\n",
    "    - Only click/submit events trigger requests\n",
    "    - Only GET & POST methods available\n",
    "    - Only full page replacement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer — the library handles everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL (like `href` or `action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical — no need for full documents. Browser's native HTML parser handles insertion efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element. Example: `hx-target=\"#main\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default, inside target), `outerHTML` (replace entire target), `beforeend` (append), `afterbegin` (prepend).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`. Can use any DOM event.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`. Useful for global shortcuts or cross-component communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**:\n",
    "    - *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET\n",
    "    - *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs: `hx-include=\"#search, .filters\"`\n",
    "    - *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values: `hx-vals='{\"key\":\"value\"}'` or `hx-vals='js:{\"key\":fn()}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Partial updates don't always warrant URL changes. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist on same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element without needing explicit IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works. For browser refresh, server must distinguish htmx requests (partial) from regular requests (full page) via `HX-Request` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple, bring in other libraries only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — JavaScript (and htmx) can modify it directly, and browser re-renders affected parts. This enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx finally delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where We're Headed**: The next chapter covers \"Htmx Patterns\" — practical application patterns using these core attributes."

But, with the additional functionality that htmx provides, we will have a more _powerful hypermedia_ to work with, allowing us to accomplish much more sophisticated interfaces.\n",

    "## Installing Htmx\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is install htmx in our web application. We are going to do this by downloading the source and saving it locally in our application, so we aren’t dependent on any external systems. This is known as “vendoring” the library. We can grab the latest version of htmx by navigating our browser to `https://unpkg.com/htmx.org`, which will redirect us to the source of the latest version of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can save the content from this URL into the `static/js/htmx.js` file in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, of course, use a more sophisticated JavaScript package manager such as Node Package Manager (NPM) or yarn to install htmx. You do this by referring to its package name, `htmx.org`, in the manner appropriate for your tool. However, htmx is very small (approximately 12kb when compressed and zipped) and is dependency free, so using it does not require an elaborate mechanism or build tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "With htmx downloaded locally to our applications `/static/js` directory, we can now load it in to our application. We do this by adding the following `script` tag to the `head` tag in our `layout.html` file, which will make htmx available and active on every page in our application:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "      <script src=\"/js/htmx.js\"></script>\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing htmx\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the `layout.html` file is a _layout_ file included in most templates that wraps the content of those templates in common HTML, including a `head` element that we are using here to install htmx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Believe it or not, that’s it! This simple script tag will make htmx’s functionality available across our entire application.\n",

    "## AJAX-ifying Our Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our feet wet with htmx, the first feature we are going to take advantage of is known as “boosting.” This is a bit of a “magic” feature in that we don’t need to do much beyond adding a single attribute, `hx-boost`, to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you put `hx-boost` on a given element with the value `true`, it will “boost” all anchor and form elements within that element. “Boost”, here, means that htmx will convert all those anchors and forms from “normal” hypermedia controls into AJAX-powered hypermedia controls. Rather than issuing “normal” HTTP requests that replace the whole page, the links and forms will issue AJAX requests. Htmx then swaps the inner content of the `<body>` tag in the response to these requests into the existing pages `<body>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes navigation feel faster because the browser will not be re-interpreting most of the tags in the response `<head>` and so forth.\n",

    "### Boosted Links\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at an example of a boosted link. Below is a link to a hypothetical settings page for a web application. Because it has `hx-boost=\"true\"` on it, htmx will halt the normal link behavior of issuing a request to the `/settings` path and replacing the entire page with the response. Instead, htmx will issue an AJAX request to `/settings`, take the result and replace the `body` element with the new content.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <a href=\"/settings\" hx-boost=\"true\">Settings</a> <1>\n",
    "\n",
    "A boosted link\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The `hx-boost` attribute makes this link AJAX-powered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might reasonably ask: what’s the advantage here? We are issuing an AJAX request and simply replacing the entire body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that significantly different from just issuing a normal link request?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is in fact different: with a boosted link, the browser is able to avoid any processing associated with the head tag. The head tag often contains many scripts and CSS file references. In the boosted scenario, it is not necessary to re-process those resources: the scripts and styles have already been processed and will continue to apply to the new content. This can often be a very easy way to speed up your hypermedia application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second question you might have is: does the response need to be formatted specially to work with `hx-boost`? After all, the settings page would normally render an `html` tag, with a `head` tag and so forth. Do you need to handle “boosted” requests specially?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no: htmx is smart enough to pull out only the content of the `body` tag to swap in to the new page. The `head` tag is mostly ignored: only the title tag, if it is present, will be processed. This means you don’t need to do anything special on the server side to render templates that `hx-boost` can handle: just return the normal HTML for your page, and it should work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that boosted links (and forms) will also continue to update the navigation bar and history, just like normal links, so users will be able to use the browser back button, will be able to copy and paste URLs (or “deep links”) and so on. Links will act pretty much like “normal”, they will just be faster.\n",

    "\n",
    "We mentioned previously that one of the annoying things about HTML is that you can’t issue an HTTP `DELETE` (or `PUT` or `PATCH`) request directly, even though these are all part of HTTP and HTTP is _obviously designed_ for transferring HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, now, with htmx, we have a chance to rectify this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “right thing,” from a RESTful, resource-oriented perspective is, rather than issuing an HTTP `POST` to `/contacts/42/delete`, to issue an HTTP `DELETE` to `/contacts/42`.

By using a `DELETE` we disambiguate between a request intended to update the contact and a request intended to delete it, using the native HTTP tools available for exactly this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have done something pretty magical here: we have turned this button into a _hypermedia control_.

    "## Next Steps: Validating Contact Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s move on to another improvement in our application. A big part of any web app is validating the data that is submitted to the server: ensuring emails are correctly formatted and unique, numeric values are valid, dates are acceptable, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, our application has a small amount of validation that is done entirely server-side and that displays an error message when an error is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to go into the details of how validation works in the model objects, but recall what the code for updating a contact looks like from Chapter 3:\n",

If the `save()` method does not return true, that indicates that there was a validation error; instead of redirecting, we re-render the HTML for editing the contact. This gives the user a chance to correct the errors, which are displayed alongside the inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Server-Side Validation Logic**\n",

This is a very common validation example: emails are usually unique and adding two contacts with the same email is almost certainly a user error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we are not going into the details of how validation works in our models, but almost all server-side frameworks provide ways to validate data and collect errors to display to the user. This sort of infrastructure is very common in Web 1.0 server-side frameworks.\n",

    "### Click To Load\n",
    "\n",
    "This paging mechanism is fine for a basic web application, and it is used extensively on the internet. But it has some drawbacks associated with it: every time you click the “Next” or “Previous” buttons you get a whole new page of contacts and lose any context you had on the previous page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a more advanced paging UI pattern might be better. Maybe, rather than loading in a new page of elements and replacing the current elements, it would be nicer to append the next page of elements _inline_ , after the current elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "In [fig-clicktoload], you have a button that you can click, and it will load the next set of contacts directly into the page, rather than “paging” to the next page. This allows you to keep the current contacts “in context” visually on the page, but still progress through them as you would in a normal, paged user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how we can implement this UX pattern in htmx.\n",

    "Second, we want to replace this _entire_ row with whatever content comes back from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we want to yank out only the `tr` elements in the response. We are replacing this `tr` element with a new set of `tr` elements, which will have additional contact information in them, as well as, if necessary, a new “Load More” button that points to the _next_ next page. To do this, we use a CSS selector `tbody > tr` to ensure we only pull out the rows in the body of the table in the response. This avoids including rows in the table header, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we issue an HTTP `GET` to the url that will serve the next page of contacts, which looks just like the “Next” link from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, no server-side changes are necessary for this new functionality. This is because of the flexibility that htmx gives you with respect to how it processes server responses.\n",

    "Another common pattern for dealing with large sets of things is known as the “Infinite Scroll” pattern. In this pattern, as the last item of a list or table of elements is scrolled into view, more elements are loaded and appended to the list or table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this behavior makes more sense in situations where a user is exploring a category or series of social media posts, rather than in the context of a contact application. However, for completeness, and to just show what you can do with htmx, we will implement this pattern as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can repurpose the “Click To Load” code to implement this new pattern quite easily: if you think about it for a moment, infinite scroll is really just the “Click To Load” logic, but rather than loading when a click event occurs, we want to load when an element is “revealed” in the view portal of the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "As luck would have it, htmx offers a synthetic (non-standard) DOM event, `revealed` that can be used in tandem with the `hx-trigger` attribute, to trigger a request when, well, when an element is revealed.\n",

    "\n",
