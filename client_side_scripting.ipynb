    "Overall summary up to this point.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\", \"Components of a Hypermedia System\", \"A Web 1.0 Application\", \"Extending HTML As Hypermedia\", \"Htmx Patterns\", \"More Htmx Patterns\", \"A Dynamic Archive UI\", and \"Tricks Of The Htmx Masters\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Four Components of a Hypermedia System**: Hypermedia (HTML), network protocol (HTTP), hypermedia server (responds to requests), hypermedia client (browser interprets responses). All four must work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators uniquely identify resources. Components: scheme (protocol), host (domain), port, path, query, fragment. Relative URLs inherit from current document.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **HTTP Basics**: Simple request/response protocol. Request headers (like `Accept`) tell server preferences; response headers provide metadata. Content negotiation allows same URL to return different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **HTTP Methods**: GET (read), POST (create/catch-all), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove). Map roughly to CRUD. HTML only supports GET and POST natively — a limitation htmx addresses. Methods are conventions, not enforced constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **HTTP Response Codes**: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error. Subtle differences matter (302 vs 303). Using codes properly goes \"with the grain\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Caching**: `Cache-Control` header indicates cacheability. `Vary` header tells caches which request headers affect the response (important for htmx's `HX-Request` header).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Hypermedia Servers**: Any language works — hypermedia frees you from JavaScript lock-in. \"HOWL\" = Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Hypermedia Clients**: Must generically interpret hypermedia controls. Browsers don't know what a \"contact\" is — they just render HTML. JSON API clients expect fixed formats, which is why HATEOAS hasn't caught on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **REST (Original Meaning)**: Fielding's dissertation described the pre-API web. Most \"REST APIs\" today aren't RESTful by his definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **REST Constraints**: *Client-Server*: Obvious for web apps. *Statelessness*: Each request self-contained (sessions/cookies technically violate this — pragmatic trade-off). *Caching*: Responses indicate cacheability. *Uniform Interface*: The core innovation. *Layered System*: Intermediaries (CDNs, proxies) allowed. *Code-On-Demand*: Scripting is optional — should augment, not replace hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Uniform Interface Sub-constraints**: *Identification of resources*: URLs uniquely identify resources. *Manipulation through representations*: You exchange representations, not resources directly. *Self-descriptive messages*: All info needed is in the response itself. *HATEOAS*: Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State — available actions encoded in HTML, not in client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **HATEOAS & API Churn**: Hypermedia APIs don't need versioning. Server changes, client automatically gets new controls. JSON APIs require documentation exchange and coordinated updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Core Trade-off**: Hypermedia is less efficient (more bytes) but vastly more flexible — clients need zero domain knowledge, just render what arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Routes & Handlers**: URLs map to Python functions via decorators (`@app.route(\"/contacts\")`). The handler processes the request and returns a response (HTML or redirect).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Same Path, Different Methods**: A single URL can have multiple handlers distinguished by HTTP method. `/contacts/new` uses GET to show a form, POST to process submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Templates generate complete HTML on the server. The browser receives ready-to-render hypermedia, not JSON + client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Template Inheritance**: Base layouts (`layout.html`) provide common \"chrome\"; child templates inject content into `{% block %}` sections. DRY on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)**: After a successful POST, redirect to a GET. This makes the \"current page\" a safe GET request, so refresh doesn't resubmit the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Query Parameters vs Path Parameters**: Query: `?q=joe` for search/filtering. Path: `/contacts/42` for identifying specific resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **Forms as Hypermedia Controls**: `<form action=\"/contacts/new\" method=\"post\">` encodes everything the browser needs — destination, method, input names. No client-side logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Error Handling Pattern**: If validation fails, re-render the same form with the contact object (which now contains errors). User sees their input preserved + error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Resource-Oriented URLs**: `/contacts` — collection. `/contacts/new` — form to create. `/contacts/42` — single resource. `/contacts/42/edit` — form to edit. `/contacts/42/delete` — delete action.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. **HTML's Method Limitations**: Forms only support GET and POST. No PUT, PATCH, or DELETE natively. This is a real constraint that htmx addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **Accidentally RESTful**: By using hypermedia (HTML), the app naturally satisfies REST constraints — HATEOAS, self-descriptive messages, loose coupling — without explicit effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. **Server-Side Factoring**: Unlike SPAs with tiny client-side components, hypermedia apps factor at coarser grain — shared template sections rather than isolated widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. **The Web 1.0 Trade-off**: The app is architecturally sound and truly RESTful, but \"clunky\" — full page reloads, flicker, lost scroll state.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. **Four Limitations of HTML as Hypermedia**: Only anchors & forms can make requests. Only click/submit events trigger requests. Only GET & POST methods available. Only full page replacement possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. **htmx Installation**: Simple script tag inclusion — no build system required. Can use CDN with integrity hash for security, or download locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. **htmx Core Philosophy**: Extends HTML declaratively via attributes. No JavaScript writing required by the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. **Request Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete` — any element can issue any HTTP method. Value is the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "39. **Responses are HTML**: htmx expects HTML back, not JSON. Partial HTML snippets are typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. **Targeting with `hx-target`**: CSS selector specifying where response HTML goes. Default is inside the triggering element.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. **Swap Styles with `hx-swap`**: Controls *how* content is inserted. Common values: `innerHTML` (default), `outerHTML`, `beforeend`, `afterbegin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "42. **Triggers with `hx-trigger`**: Specifies which event fires the request. Defaults: inputs/textareas/selects → `change`, forms → `submit`, everything else → `click`.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. **Event Filters**: Square bracket syntax filters events: `hx-trigger=\"keyup[ctrlKey && key == 'l']\"`. Filter is JavaScript evaluated against the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. **Listening to Other Elements**: `from:` modifier listens elsewhere: `hx-trigger=\"keyup from:body\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. **Event Bubbling**: Events bubble up through ancestors. You can catch descendant events without `from:`. Use `from:` when source is outside your element's ancestry.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. **Passing Data — Three Methods**: *Enclosing forms*: Auto-included for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, NOT for GET. *`hx-include`*: Explicit CSS selector for inputs. *`hx-vals`*: Static or dynamic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "47. **Why GET Doesn't Auto-Include Form Data**: htmx avoids URL clutter in browser history. Opt-in via `hx-include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **`id` vs `name` Attributes**: `id` is for browser-side targeting (CSS, htmx). `name` is for server-side data keys. Both can coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. **Relative CSS Selectors**: `closest`, `next`, `previous`, `find`, `this` — select elements relative to current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. **History Support with `hx-push-url`**: Pushes URL to browser history. Back/forward navigation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. **The Eight Core Attributes**: `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-patch`, `hx-delete`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap` — address all four HTML limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. **htmx Trade-off**: Less \"infrastructure\" than SPA frameworks (no built-in state management, routing, component systems). Philosophy: stay simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Browser's internal tree representation of parsed HTML. Live and mutable — enables partial updates without full page refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **Transclusion**: Ted Nelson's 1980 concept — including content into an existing document via hypermedia reference. htmx delivers this for HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. **`hx-boost`**: Converts all anchor and form elements within an element into AJAX-powered controls. Place on `<body>` to boost entire app.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. **`hx-boost` Limitation**: New `<head>` content in responses is ignored (except `<title>`). Works best when all pages share the same layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. **Attribute Inheritance**: Most htmx attributes cascade to children (like CSS). Override with explicit values on specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "58. **Progressive Enhancement**: `hx-boost` degrades gracefully — if JS disabled, links/forms work normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. **Explicit vs Implicit Philosophy**: htmx generally prefers explicit attribute declarations over magic. `hx-boost` is the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. **Delete with HTTP DELETE**: Use `hx-delete=\"/contacts/{{ id }}\"` on a button — no form wrapper needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. **Response Code 303**: After DELETE (or PUT/PATCH), use `redirect(\"/path\", 303)` not default 302. Explicitly means \"redirect and switch to GET.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "62. **`hx-confirm`**: Add confirmation dialogs with `hx-confirm=\"Are you sure?\"`. Uses browser's native `confirm()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. **Graceful Degradation Trade-off**: The DELETE button won't work without JS. Supporting both htmx and fallback requires duplicate routes/handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. **Client-Side vs Server-Side Validation**: HTML5 `type=\"email\"` handles format validation client-side (but can't be trusted). Uniqueness validation *requires* server.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. **Inline Validation Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` to an input. On `change` event, htmx requests server validation and updates error span.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. **Triggering Element Includes Its Own Value**: When an input triggers a request, its own name/value is automatically included.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. **`keyup` Trigger for Live Validation**: Add `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup\"` for validation as user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. **Debouncing with `delay`**: Use `hx-trigger=\"change, keyup delay:200ms\"` to wait until user pauses. Resets timer on each keystroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. **`changed` Modifier**: Add `changed` to trigger to only fire when input value actually changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. **Paging Basics**: Pass `page` query parameter, server returns appropriate slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. **Click To Load Pattern**: Replace \"Next\" link with button using `hx-get`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, `hx-select=\"tbody > tr\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. **`hx-select`**: CSS selector to extract specific content from server response before swapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. **Infinite Scroll Pattern**: Same as click-to-load but trigger on `revealed` event instead of click.\n",
    "\n",
    "74. **Modals Caution**: Modal windows introduce client-side state that doesn't map to URLs. Use sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "75. **`display: none` Accessibility**: Hides elements from accessibility tree and keyboard focus, not just visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "76. **The Core htmx Pattern**: \"Event → Request → Swap.\" Many UX patterns become variations on this theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. **Active Search Pattern**: Add `hx-get`, `hx-trigger=\"search, keyup delay:200ms changed\"`, and `hx-target` to a search input.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **The `search` Event**: A non-standard event triggered when user clears search input or hits enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. **Template Factoring Pattern**: Break templates into reusable fragments. Same fragment serves full page and htmx partial updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. **Jinja `include` Directive**: `{% include 'rows.html' %}` inserts another template's content at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "81. **htmx Request Headers**: `HX-Request`, `HX-Trigger`, `HX-Target`, `HX-Boosted`, `HX-Current-URL` automatically added.\n",
    "\n",
    "82. **Using `HX-Trigger` for Conditional Responses**: Server checks which element initiated the request. Allows same endpoint to return different content.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **Bookmarks and `HX-Trigger`**: When user opens bookmarked URL directly, there's no htmx — no `HX-Trigger` header. Server returns full page.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **`Vary` Header for Caching**: When returning different content based on htmx headers, add `Vary: HX-Trigger` to responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "85. **`hx-push-url` with Active Search**: Updates browser URL as user types, enabling bookmarks and back button.\n",
    "\n",
    "86. **Request Indicators with `hx-indicator`**: CSS selector pointing to a spinner element to show during requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "87. **Indicators Inside Elements**: For one-time requests, place indicator *inside* target element — self-cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "88. **Throttling for Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "89. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: Defer expensive operations to secondary requests. Main page loads fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "90. **`hx-trigger=\"load\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element is added to DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "91. **`hx-trigger=\"revealed\"`**: Synthetic htmx event fired when element scrolls into viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "92. **Synthetic vs Native Events**: `load` and `revealed` are htmx-invented events with no meaning in vanilla JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "93. **Lazy Loading Sequence**: Main page → placeholder renders → htmx fires secondary request → response fills placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. **Perceived Performance**: Lazy loading improves *perceived* performance — users can interact immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "95. **Inline Delete Pattern**: Add `hx-delete`, `hx-target=\"closest tr\"`, `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"`, and `hx-confirm` to a delete link.\n",
    "\n",
    "96. **Empty Response for Removal**: When `hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"` receives empty string, target element is removed from DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "97. **Distinguishing Delete Sources**: Add `id` to delete buttons to differentiate via `HX-Trigger` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "98. **htmx Swapping Model**: Content goes through phases: `htmx-swapping` class → swap delay → `htmx-settling` class → settle delay. Enables CSS transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "99. **CSS Transitions with htmx**: Write CSS rules targeting `htmx-swapping` or `htmx-settling` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "100. **Swap Delay Modifier**: `hx-swap=\"outerHTML swap:1s\"` gives CSS transitions time to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "101. **Fade-Out Delete Pattern**: Combine swap delay with CSS transition on `htmx-swapping` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "102. **Bulk Delete Pattern**: Wrap table and delete button in a `<form>`. Add checkboxes with same `name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "103. **Checkbox Form Behavior**: Multiple checkboxes with same `name` submit all checked values as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "104. **No Redirect for Same-Page Updates**: When already on the page being re-rendered, skip the redirect.\n",
    "\n",
    "105. **Full-Stack Advantage**: Controlling both frontend and backend enables returning partial HTML based on request context.\n",
    "\n",
    "106. **Long-Running Process Problem**: Blocking until complete = bad UX. Non-blocking with immediate response = better UX.\n",
    "\n",
    "107. **Common Async UI Patterns**: Email when complete, manual refresh, auto-refresh with JS timer.\n",
    "\n",
    "108. **Non-Blocking Design**: Server starts background job, responds immediately with progress UI. Client polls for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "109. **Polling**: Client repeatedly asks server \"are you done yet?\" at intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "110. **Fixed-Rate Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"every 3s\"` — polls indefinitely on a timer.\n",
    "\n",
    "111. **Load Polling**: `hx-trigger=\"load delay:500ms\"` — each response triggers the next request. Server controls continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "112. **Load Polling Chain**: Response includes trigger → element loads → fires request after delay → repeat. Omit trigger to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "113. **Same URL, Multiple Methods Pattern**: POST starts job; GET checks status; DELETE resets/cancels.\n",
    "\n",
    "114. **Single Template, Multiple States**: One template handles all UI states with Jinja `{% if %}` / `{% elif %}` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "115. **Archiver API Pattern**: `status()`, `progress()`, `run()`, `reset()`, `archive_file()`. Clean separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "116. **CSS Progress Bar**: Outer div (frame) + inner div (bar). Set inner div's `width` as percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "117. **ARIA for Custom Widgets**: `role=\"progressbar\"` and `aria-valuenow=\"50\"` make div-based progress bars accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "118. **File Downloads via HTTP**: `Content-Disposition: attachment` header tells browser to save response as file.\n",
    "\n",
    "119. **`hx-boost=\"false\"` for Downloads**: Opt out of AJAX for file download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "120. **CSS Transitions Don't Fire on Replacement**: Transitions animate property *changes* on existing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "121. **htmx Settling Mechanism**: htmx matches elements by `id`, copies old attributes, swaps, then restores new attributes — creating animatable change.\n",
    "\n",
    "122. **Stable ID Requirement**: For settling/smooth transitions, element needs the **same** `id` in both old and new HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "123. **Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting**: Scripting is acceptable when it *enhances* rather than *replaces* hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "124. **HTML Entities**: `&downarrow;` → ↓, `&amp;` → &, `&lt;` → <, `&copy;` → ©.\n",
    "\n",
    "125. **Flask Context Processors**: `@app.context_processor` injects variables into all templates automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "126. **Markdown Soup**: Using Markdown elements for *appearance* rather than semantic *meaning*. Prefer conformant HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "127. **`hx-swap` Modifiers Beyond Basics**: `settle` (delay before attribute settling), `show` (scroll element into viewport, e.g., `show:body:top`), `scroll` (scroll scrollable element to top/bottom), `focus-scroll` (scroll to focused element).\n",
    "\n",
    "128. **`delay` vs `throttle`**: `delay:200ms` resets timer on every event, fires after silence (search-as-you-type). `throttle:200ms` fires immediately, then ignores events for interval (scroll/resize handlers).\n",
    "\n",
    "129. **Additional `hx-trigger` Modifiers**: `once` (trigger only once), `target` (filter to events directly on specific element), `consume` (cancel event, prevent bubbling), `queue` (control event queuing during in-flight requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "130. **Trigger Filters**: JavaScript expression in square brackets evaluated on each event: `hx-trigger=\"click[contactRetrievalEnabled()]\"`. Request proceeds only if truthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "131. **`intersect` Synthetic Event**: More fine-grained than `revealed` — can specify threshold (e.g., trigger when 50% visible).\n",
    "\n",
    "132. **`hx-preserve`**: Keeps element unchanged during swaps — useful for preserving partially-filled forms or video players. Requires stable `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "133. **`hx-sync`**: Synchronize requests between multiple elements. Prevents race conditions. Value `this` on parent syncs all children.\n",
    "\n",
    "134. **`hx-disable`**: Disables all htmx behavior on element and children. Security feature for user-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "135. **Events as \"Glue\"**: DOM is essentially an event bus. Events connect DOM, HTML, htmx, and scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "136. **htmx-Emitted Events**: `htmx:load` (content loaded), `htmx:configRequest` (before request — can modify/cancel), `htmx:afterRequest` (after completion), `htmx:abort` (send to element to cancel in-flight request).\n",
    "\n",
    "137. **`htmx:configRequest` for Global Request Modification**: Listen on `document.body`, modify `evt.detail.headers` or `evt.detail.parameters` to add auth tokens to every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "138. **`localStorage`**: Browser-side key-value storage that persists across sessions. Server cannot access directly — JavaScript must explicitly read and send it. Different from cookies (auto-sent with every request).\n",
    "\n",
    "139. **`detail` Property Convention**: Web standard for custom events — data goes in `detail` to avoid conflicts with native event properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "140. **`htmx:abort` Pattern**: Send this event to an htmx element to cancel its in-flight request. Useful for \"Cancel\" buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "141. **Hyperscript for UI State**: `_=\"on htmx:beforeRequest remove @disabled from me\"` — enables Cancel button only while request is in flight. `@disabled` grays out and prevents clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "142. **`HX-Trigger` Response Header**: Server can trigger client-side events by including event name in response header. Enables decoupled coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "143. **Decoupled Coordination Pattern**: Button announces event, doesn't know who listens. Table listens on `body` (events bubble up). Loose coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "144. **htmx Response Headers**: `HX-Location` (client-side redirect), `HX-Push-Url` (push URL to location bar), `HX-Refresh` (refresh page), `HX-Retarget` (change swap target).\n",
    "\n",
    "145. **Special Response Codes**: `204 No Content` (htmx skips swap entirely), `286` (stops polling).\n",
    "\n",
    "146. **`htmx:beforeSwap` Event**: Intercept before swap. Can check `evt.detail.xhr.status` to handle error codes. Can modify whether/where swap occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "147. **Three Approaches to \"Update Other Content\"**: (1) **Expand target** (simplest): Make target large enough. (2) **Out-of-band swaps**: Piggyback extra content with `hx-swap-oob=\"true\"`. (3) **Server-triggered events**: Use `HX-Trigger` header (most flexible, most complex).\n",
    "\n",

    "> REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — Roy Fielding, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have (mostly) avoided writing any JavaScript (or _hyperscript) in Contact.app, mainly because the functionality we implemented has not required it. In this chapter we are going to look at scripting and, in particular, hypermedia-friendly scripting within the context of a Hypermedia-Driven Application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is Scripting Allowed?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common criticism of the web is that it’s being misused. There is a narrative that WWW was created as a delivery system for “documents”, and only came to be used for “applications” by way of an accident or bizarre circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the concept of hypermedia challenges the split of document and application. Hypermedia systems like HyperCard, which preceded the web, featured rich capabilities for active and interactive experiences, including scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML, as specified and implemented, does lack affordances needed to build highly interactive applications. This doesn’t mean, however, that hypermedia’s _purpose_ is “documents” over “applications.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, while the theoretical foundation is there, the implementation is underdeveloped. With JavaScript being the only extension point and hypermedia controls not being well integrated to JavaScript (why can’t one click a link without halting the program?), developers have not internalized hypermedia and have instead used the web as a dumb pipe for apps that imitate “native” ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A goal of this book is to show that it is possible to build sophisticated web applications using the original technology of the web, hypermedia, without the application developer needing to reach for the abstractions provided by the large, popular JavaScript frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Htmx itself is, of course, written in JavaScript, and one of its advantages is that hypermedia interactions that go through htmx expose a rich interface to JavaScript code with configuration, events, and htmx’s own extension support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Htmx expands the expressiveness of HTML enough that it removes the need for scripting in many situations. This makes htmx attractive to people who don’t want to write JavaScript, and there are many of those sorts of developers, wary of the complexity of Single Page Application frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, dunking on JavaScript is not the aim of the htmx project. The goal of htmx is not less JavaScript, but less code, more readable and hypermedia-friendly code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting has been a massive force multiplier for the web. Using scripting, web application developers are not only able to enhance their HTML websites, but also create full-fledged client-side applications that can often compete with native, thick client applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This JavaScript-centric approach to building web applications is a testament to the power of the web and to the sophistication of web browsers in particular. It has its place in web development: there are situations where the hypermedia approach simply can’t provide the level of interaction that an SPA can.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in addition to this more JavaScript-centric style, we want to develop a style of scripting more compatible and consistent with Hypermedia-Driven Applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting for Hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Borrowing from Roy Fielding’s notion of “constraints” defining REST, we offer two constraints of hypermedia-friendly scripting. You are scripting in an HDA-compatible manner if the following two constraints are adhered to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The main data format exchanged between server and client must be hypermedia, the same as it would be without scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Client-side state, outside the DOM itself, is kept to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these constraints is to confine scripting to where it shines best and where nothing else comes close: _interaction design_. Business logic and presentation logic are the responsibility of the server, where we can pick whichever languages or tools are appropriate for our business domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping business logic and presentation logic both “on the server” does not mean these two “concerns” are mixed or coupled. They can be modularized on the server. In fact, they _should_ be modularized on the server, along with all the other concerns of our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that, especially in web development parlance, the humble “server” is usually a whole fleet of racks, virtual machines, containers and more. Even a worldwide network of datacenters is reduced to “the server” when discussing the server-side of a Hypermedia-Driven Application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfying these two constraints sometimes requires us to diverge from what is typically considered best practice for JavaScript. Keep in mind that the cultural wisdom of JavaScript was largely developed in JavaScript-centric SPA applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hypermedia-Driven Application cannot as comfortably fall back on this tradition. This chapter is our contribution to the development of a new style and best practices for what we are calling Hypermedia-Driven Applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, simply listing “best practices” is rarely convincing or edifying. To be honest, it’s boring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will demonstrate these best practices by implementing client-side features in Contact.app. To cover different aspects of hypermedia-friendly scripting, we will implement three different features:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An overflow menu to hold the _Edit_ , _View_ and _Delete_ actions, to clean up visual clutter in our list of contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An improved interface for bulk deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A keyboard shortcut for focusing the search box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The important takeaway in the implementation of each of these features is that, while they are implemented entirely on the client-side using scripting, they _don’t exchange information with the server_ via a non-hypermedia format, such as JSON, and that they don’t store a significant amount of state outside of the DOM itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting Tools for the Web\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary scripting language for the web is, of course, JavaScript, which is ubiquitous in web development today.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of interesting internet lore, however, is that JavaScript was not always the only built-in option. As the quote from Roy Fielding at the start of this chapter hints, “applets” written in other languages such as Java were considered to be part of the scripting infrastructure of the web. In addition, there was a time period when Internet Explorer supported VBScript, a scripting language based on Visual Basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we have a variety of _transcompilers_ (often shortened to _transpilers_) that convert many languages to JavaScript, such as TypeScript, Dart, Kotlin, ClojureScript, F# and more. There is also the WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode format, which is supported as a compilation target for C, Rust, and the WASM-first language AssemblyScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of these options are not geared towards a hypermedia-friendly style of scripting. Compile-to-JS languages are often paired with SPA-oriented libraries (Dart and AngularDart, ClojureScript and Reagent, F# and Elm), and WASM is currently mainly geared toward linking to C/C++ libraries from JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will instead focus on three client-side scripting technologies that _are_ hypermedia-friendly:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * VanillaJS, that is, using JavaScript without depending on any framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Alpine.js, a JavaScript library for adding behavior directly in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * _hyperscript, a non-JavaScript scripting language created alongside htmx. Like AlpineJS, _hyperscript is usually embedded in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a quick look at each of these scripting options, so we know what we are dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, as with CSS, we are going to show you just enough of each of these options to give a flavor of how they work and, we hope, spark your interest in looking into any of them more extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vanilla JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "> No code is faster than no code.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — Merb (Ruby web framework), motto\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla JavaScript is simply using plain JavaScript in your application, without any intermediate layers. The term “Vanilla” entered frontend web dev parlance as it became assumed that any sufficiently “advanced” web app would use some library with a name ending in “.js”. As JavaScript matured as a scripting language, however, standardized across browsers and provided more and more functionality, these frameworks and libraries became less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat ironically though, as JavaScript became more powerful and removed the need for the first generation of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, it also enabled people to build complex SPA libraries. These SPA libraries are often even more elaborate than the original first generation of JavaScript libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quote from the website <http://vanilla-js.com>, which is well worth visiting even though it’s slightly out of date, captures the situation well:\n",
    "\n",
    "> VanillaJS is the lowest-overhead, most comprehensive framework I’ve ever used.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — http://vanilla-js.com\n",
    "\n",
    "With JavaScript having matured as a scripting language, this is certainly the case for many applications. It is especially true in the case of HDAs, since, by using hypermedia, your application will not need many of the features typically provided by more elaborate Single Page Application JavaScript frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Client-side routing\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An abstraction over DOM manipulation (i.e., templates that automatically update when referenced variables change)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Server side rendering 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Attaching dynamic behavior to server-rendered tags on load (i.e., “hydration”)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Network requests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Without all this complexity being handled in JavaScript, your framework needs are dramatically reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best things about VanillaJS is how you install it: you don’t have to!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can just start writing JavaScript in your web application, and it will simply work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the good news. The bad news is that, despite improvements over the last decade, JavaScript has some significant limitations as a scripting language that can make it less than ideal as a stand-alone scripting technology for Hypermedia-Driven Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Being as established as it is, it has accreted a lot of features and warts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It has a complicated and confusing set of features for working with asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Working with events is surprisingly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * DOM APIs (a large portion of which were originally designed for Java, yes _Java_) are verbose and don’t have a habit of making common functionality easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these limitations are deal-breakers, of course. Many of them are gradually being fixed and many people prefer the “close to the metal” (for lack of a better term) nature of vanilla JavaScript over more elaborate client-side scripting approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "To dive into vanilla JavaScript as a front end scripting option, let’s create a simple counter widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter widgets are a common “Hello World” example for JavaScript frameworks, so looking at how it can be done in vanilla JavaScript (as well as the other options we are going to look at) will be instructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our counter widget will be very simple: it will have a number, shown as text, and a button that increments the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with tackling this problem in vanilla JavaScript is that it lacks one thing that most JavaScript frameworks provide: a default code and architectural style.\n",
    "\n",
    "With vanilla JavaScript, there are no rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t all bad. It presents a great opportunity to take a small journey through various styles that people have developed for writing their JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An inline implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let’s start with the simplest thing imaginable: all of our JavaScript will be written inline, directly in the HTML. When the button is clicked, we will look up the `output` element holding the number, and increment the number contained within it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<section class=\"counter\">\n",
    "  <output id=\"my-output\">0</output>  <1>\n",
    "  <button\n",
    "    onclick=\" <2>\n",
    "      document.querySelector('#my-output') <3>\n",
    "        .textContent++ <4>\n",
    "    \"\n",
    "  >Increment</button>\n",
    "</section>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter in vanilla JavaScript, inline version\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Our output element has an ID to help us find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. We use the `onclick` attribute to add an event listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Find the output via a querySelector() call.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. JavaScript allows us use the `++` operator on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Not too bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not the most beautiful code, and can be irritating especially if you aren’t used to the DOM APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a little annoying that we needed to add an `id` to the `output` element. The `document.querySelector()` function is a bit verbose compared with, say, the `$` function, as provided by jQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it works. It’s also easy enough to understand, and crucially it doesn’t require any other JavaScript libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s the simple, inline approach with VanillaJS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separating our scripting out\n",
    "\n",
    "While the inline implementation is simple in some sense, a more standard way to write this would be to move the code into a separate JavaScript file. This JavaScript file would then either be linked to via a `<script src>` tag or placed into an inline `<script>` tag by a build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the HTML and JavaScript _separated out_ from one another, in different files. The HTML is now “cleaner” in that there is no JavaScript in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaScript is a bit more complex than in our inline version: we need to look up the button using a query selector and add an _event listener_ to handle the click event and increment the counter.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<section class=\"counter\">\n",
    "  <output id=\"my-output\">0</output>\n",
    "  <button class=\"increment-btn\">Increment</button>\n",
    "</section>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter HTML\n",
    "```\n",
    "const counterOutput = document.querySelector(\"#my-output\"), <1>\n",
    "  incrementBtn = document.querySelector(\".counter .increment-btn\") <2>\n",
    "\n",
    "incrementBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", e => { <3>\n",
    "  counterOutput.innerHTML++ <4>\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Find the output element.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Find the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. We use `addEventListener`, which is preferable to `onclick` for many reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. The logic stays the same, only the structure around it changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In moving the JavaScript out to another file, we are following a software design principle known as _Separation of Concerns (SoC)._\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns posits that the various “concerns” (or aspects) of a software project should be divided up into multiple files, so that they don’t “pollute” one another. JavaScript isn’t markup, so it shouldn’t be in your HTML, it should be _elsewhere_. Styling information, similarly, isn’t markup, and so it belongs in a separate file as well (A CSS file, for example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For quite some time, this Separation of Concerns was considered the “orthodox” way to build web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stated goal of Separation of Concerns is that we should be able to modify and evolve each concern independently, with confidence that we won’t break any of the other concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let’s look at exactly how this principle has worked out in our simple counter example. If you look closely at the new HTML, it turns out that we’ve had to add a class to the button. We added this class so that we could look the button up in JavaScript and add in an event handler for the “click” event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in both the HTML and the JavaScript, this class name is just a string and there isn’t any process to _verify_ that the button has the right classes on it or its ancestors to ensure that the event handler is actually added to the right element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it has turned out that the careless use of CSS selectors in JavaScript can cause what is known as _jQuery soup_. jQuery soup is a situation where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The JavaScript that attaches a given behavior to a given element is difficult to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Code reuse is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The code ends up wildly disorganized and “flat”, with lots of unrelated event handlers mixed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The name “jQuery soup” comes from the fact that most JavaScript-heavy applications used to be built in jQuery (many still are), which, perhaps inadvertently, tended to encourage this style of JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can see that the notion of Separation of Concerns doesn’t always work as well as promised: our concerns end up intertwined or coupled pretty deeply, even when we separate them into different files.\n",
    "```\n",
    " EXPECTATION              REALITY\n",
    "\n",
    " HTML   CSS    JS         HTML   CSS    JS  \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What concerns?\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that it isn’t just naming between concerns that can get you into trouble, consider another small change to our HTML that demonstrates the problems with our separation of concerns: imagine that we decide to change the number field from an `<output>` tag to an `<input type=\"number\">`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This small change to our HTML will break our JavaScript, despite the fact we have “separated” our concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fix for this issue is simple enough (we would need to change the `.textContent` property to `.value` property), but it demonstrates the burden of synchronizing markup changes and code changes across multiple files. Keeping everything in sync can become increasingly difficult as your application size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that small changes to our HTML can break our scripting indicates that the two are _tightly coupled_ , despite being broken up into multiple files. This tight coupling suggests that separation between HTML and JavaScript (and CSS) is often an illusory separation of concerns: the concerns are sufficiently related to one another that they aren’t easily separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Contact.app we are not _concerned_ with “structure,” “styling” or “behavior”; we are concerned with collecting contact info and presenting it to users. SoC, in the way it’s formulated in web development orthodoxy, is not really an inviolate architectural guideline, but rather a stylistic choice that, as we can see, can even become a hindrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locality of Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is a burgeoning reaction _against_ the Separation of Concerns design principle. Consider the following web technologies and techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * JSX\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LitHTML\n",
    "\n",
    "  * CSS-in-JS\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Single-File Components\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Filesystem based routing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these technologies _colocate_ code in various languages that address a single _feature_ (typically a UI widget).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them mix _implementation_ concerns together in order to present a unified abstraction to the end-user. Separating technical detail concerns just isn’t as much of an, ahem, concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locality of Behavior (LoB) is an alternative software design principle that we coined, in opposition to Separation of Concerns. It describes the following characteristic of a piece of software:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The behavior of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: you should be able to tell what a button does by simply looking at the code or markup that creates that button. This does not mean you need to inline the entire implementation, but that you shouldn’t need to hunt for it or require prior knowledge of the codebase to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate Locality of Behavior in all of our examples, both the counter demos and the features we add to Contact.app. Locality of behavior is an explicit design goal of both _hyperscript and Alpine.js (which we will cover later) as well as htmx.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these tools achieve Locality of Behavior by having you embed attributes directly within your HTML, as opposed to having code look up elements in a document through CSS selectors in order to add event listeners onto them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Hypermedia-Driven Application, we feel that the Locality of Behavior design principle is often more important than the more traditional Separation of Concerns design principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to do with our counter?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, should we go back to the `onclick` attribute way of doing things? That approach certainly wins in Locality of Behavior, and has the additional benefit that it is baked into HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, however, the `on*` JavaScript attributes also come with some drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They don’t support custom events.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * There is no good mechanism for associating long-lasting variables with an element — all variables are discarded when an event listener completes executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If you have multiple instances of an element, you will need to repeat the listener code on each, or use something more clever like event delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * JavaScript code that directly manipulates the DOM gets verbose, and clutters the markup.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An element cannot listen for events on another element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this common situation: you have a popup, and you want it to be dismissed when a user clicks outside of it. The listener will need to be on the body element in this situation, far away from the actual popup markup. This means that the body element would need to have listeners attached to it that deal with many unrelated components. Some of these components may not even be on the page when it was first rendered, if they are added dynamically after the initial HTML page is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "So vanilla JavaScript and Locality of Behavior don’t seem to mesh _quite_ as well as we would like them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is not hopeless, however: it’s important to understand that LoB does not require behavior to be _implemented_ at a use site, but merely _invoked_ there. That is, we don’t need to write all our code on a given element, we just need to make it clear that a given element is _invoking_ some code, which can be located elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this in mind, it _is_ possible to improve LoB while writing JavaScript in a separate file, provided we have a reasonable system for structuring our JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RSJS\n",
    "\n",
    "(the “Reasonable System for JavaScript Structure,” <https://ricostacruz.com/rsjs/>) is a set of guidelines for JavaScript architecture targeted at “a typical non-SPA website.” RSJS provides a solution to the lack of a standard code style for vanilla JavaScript that we mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the RSJS guidelines most relevant for our counter widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “Use `data-` attributes” in HTML: invoking behavior via adding data attributes makes it obvious there is JavaScript happening, as opposed to using random classes or IDs that may be mistakenly removed or changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “One component per file”: the name of the file should match the data attribute so that it can be found easily, a win for LoB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the RSJS guidelines, let’s restructure our current HTML and JavaScript files. First, we will use _data attributes_ , that is, HTML attributes that begin with `data-`, a standard feature of HTML, to indicate that our HTML is a counter component. We will then update our JavaScript to use an attribute selector that looks for the `data-counter` attribute as the root element in our counter component and wires in the appropriate event handlers and logic. Additionally, let’s rework the code to use `querySelectorAll()` and add the counter functionality to _all_ counter components found on the page. (You never know how many counters you might want!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our code looks like now:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<section class=\"counter\" data-counter> <1>\n",
    "  <output id=\"my-output\" data-counter-output>0</output> <2>\n",
    "  <button class=\"increment-btn\" data-counter-increment>Increment</button>\n",
    "</section>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter in vanilla JavaScript, with RSJS\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Invoke a JavaScript behavior with a data attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Mark relevant descendant elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// counter.js <1>\n",
    "document.querySelectorAll(\"[data-counter]\") <2>\n",
    "  .forEach(el => {\n",
    "    const\n",
    "    output = el.querySelector(\"[data-counter-output]\"),\n",
    "    increment = el.querySelector(\"[data-counter-increment]\"); <3>\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment.addEventListener(\"click\", e => output.textContent++); <4>\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. File should have the same name as the data attribute, so that we can locate it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Get all elements that invoke this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Get any child elements we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Register event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using RSJS solves, or at least alleviates, many of the problems we pointed out with our first, unstructured example of VanillaJS being split out to a separate file:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The JS that attaches behavior to a given element is _clear_ (though only through naming conventions).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Reuse is _easy_ — you can create another counter component on the page and it will just work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The code is _well-organized_ — one behavior per file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, RSJS is a good way to structure your vanilla JavaScript in a Hypermedia-Driven Application. So long as the JavaScript isn’t communicating with a server via a plain data JSON API, or holding a bunch of internal state outside of the DOM, this is perfectly compatible with the HDA approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s implement a feature in Contact.app using the RSJS/vanilla JavaScript approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VanillaJS in Action: An Overflow Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "Our homepage has “Edit”, “View” and “Delete” links for every contact in our table. This uses a lot of space and creates visual clutter. Let’s fix that by placing these actions inside a drop-down menu with a button to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re less familiar with JavaScript and the code here starts to feel too complicated, don’t worry; the Alpine.js and _hyperscript examples — which we’ll look at next — are easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by sketching the markup we want for our dropdown menu. First, we need an element, we’ll use a `<div>`, to enclose the entire widget and mark it as a menu component. Within this div, we will have a standard `<button>` that will function as the mechanism that shows and hides our menu items. Finally, we’ll have another `<div>` that holds the menu items that we are going to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "These menu items will be simple anchor tags, as they are in the current contacts table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our updated, RSJS-structured HTML looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div data-overflow-menu> <1>\n",
    "    <button type=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\"\n",
    "        aria-controls=\"contact-menu-{{ contact.id }}\"\n",

    "        <!-- ... -->\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",

    "  1. Mark the root element of the menu component\n",

    "  4. Menu items\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The roles and ARIA attributes are based on the Menu and Menu Button patterns from the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is ARIA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we web developers create more interactive, app-like websites, HTML’s repertoire of elements won’t have all we need. As we have seen, using CSS and JavaScript, we can endow existing elements with extended behavior and appearances, rivaling those of native controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there was one thing web apps couldn’t replicate. While these widgets may _look_ similar enough to the real deal, assistive technology (e.g., screen readers) could only deal with the underlying HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you take the time to get all the keyboard interactions right, some users often are unable to work with these custom elements easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIA was created by W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in 2008 to address this problem. At a surface level, it is a set of attributes you can add to HTML to make it meaningful to assistive software such as a screen reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIA has two main components that interact with one another:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the `role` attribute. This attribute has a predefined set of possible values: `menu, dialog, radiogroup` etc. The `role` attribute _does not add any behavior_ to HTML elements. Rather, it is a promise you make to the user. When you annotate an element as `role='menu'`, you are saying: _I will make this element work like a menu._\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add a `role` to an element but you _don’t_ uphold the promise, the experience for many users will be _worse_ than if the element had no `role` at all. Thus, it is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "> No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — W3C, Read Me First | APG, https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component of ARIA is the _states and properties_ , all sharing the `aria-` prefix: `aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-label` etc. These attributes can specify various things such as the state of a widget, the relationships between components, or additional semantics. Once again, these attributes are _promises_ , not implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than learn all the roles and attributes and try to combine them into a usable widget, the best course of action for most developers is to rely on the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG), a web resource with practical information aimed directly at web developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to ARIA, check out the following W3C resources:\n",

    "\n",
    "On the JS side of our implementation, we’ll begin with the RSJS boilerplate: query for all elements with some data attribute, iterate over them, get any relevant descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, below, we’ve modified the RSJS boilerplate a bit to integrate with htmx; we load the overflow menu when htmx loads new content.\n",

    "  2. To keep the HTML clean, we use ARIA attributes rather than custom data attributes here.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Use the spread operator to convert a `NodeList` into a normal `Array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Initialize all overflow menus when the page is loaded or content is inserted by htmx.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally, we would keep track of whether the menu is open using a JavaScript variable or a property in a JavaScript state object. This approach is common in large, JavaScript-heavy web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has some drawback:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We would need to keep the DOM in sync with the state (harder without a framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We would lose the ability to serialize the HTML (as this open state isn’t stored in the DOM, but rather in JavaScript).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking this approach, we will use the DOM to store our state. We’ll lean on the `hidden` attribute on the menu element to tell us it’s closed. If the HTML of the page is snapshotted and restored, the menu can be restored as well by simply re-running the JS.\n",
    "```\n",
    "items = [...menu.querySelectorAll(\"[role=menuitem]\")]; <1>\n",
    "\n",
    "const isOpen = () => !menu.hidden; <2>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. We get the list of menu items at the start. This implementation will not support dynamically adding or removing menu items.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. The `hidden` attribute is helpfully reflected as a `hidden` _property_ , so we don’t need to use `getAttribute`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also make the menu items non-tabbable, so we can manage their focus ourselves.\n",

    "button.addEventListener(\"click\", () => toggleMenu()); <4>\n",
    "menuRoot.addEventListener(\"blur\", e => toggleMenu(false)); <5>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Optional parameter to specify desired state. This allows us to use one function to open, close, or toggle the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Focus first item of menu when opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Call `toggleMenu` with current state, to initialize element attributes.\n",

    "  4. Toggle menu when button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Close menu when focus moves away.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s also make the menu close when we click outside it, a nice behavior that mimics how native drop-down menus work. This will require an event listener on the whole window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to be careful with this kind of listener: you may find that listeners accumulate as components add listeners and fail to remove them when the component is removed from the DOM. This, unfortunately, leads to difficult to track down memory leaks.\n",

    "There is not an easy way in JavaScript to execute logic when an element is removed. The best option is what is known as the `MutationObserver` API. A `MutationObserver` is very useful, but the API is quite heavy and a bit arcane, so we won’t be using it for our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will use a simple pattern to avoid leaking event listeners: when our event listener runs, we will check if the attaching component is still in the DOM, and, if the element is no longer in the DOM, we will remove the listener and exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a somewhat hacky, manual form of _garbage collection_. As is (usually) the case with other garbage collection algorithms, our strategy removes listeners in a nondeterministic amount of time after they are no longer needed. Fortunately for us, With a frequent event like “the user clicks anywhere in the page” driving the collection, it should work well enough for our system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, our drop-down menu isn’t perfect, and it doesn’t handle a lot of things. For example, we don’t support submenus, or menu items being added or removed dynamically to the menu.

    "\n",
    "But, for our relatively simple use case, vanilla JavaScript does a fine job, and we got to explore ARIA and RSJS while implementing it.\n",

    "## Alpine.js\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so that’s an in-depth look at how to structure plain VanillaJS-style JavaScript. Let’s turn our attention to an actual JavaScript framework that enables a different approach for adding dynamic behavior to your application, [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpine is a relatively new JavaScript library that allows developers to embed JavaScript code directly in HTML, akin to the `on*` attributes available in plain HTML and JavaScript. However, Alpine takes this concept of embedded scripting much further than `on*` attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpine bills itself as a modern replacement for jQuery, the widely used, older JavaScript library. As you will see, it definitely lives up to this promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Alpine is very easy: it is a single file and is dependency-free, so you can simply include it via a CDN:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/alpinejs\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install it via a package manager such as NPM, or vendor it from your own server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpine provides a set of HTML attributes, all of which begin with the `x-` prefix, the main one of which is `x-data`. The content of `x-data` is a JavaScript expression which evaluates to an object. The properties of this object can, then, be accessed within the element that the `x-data` attribute is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a flavor of AlpineJS, let’s look at how to implement our counter example using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the counter, the only state we need to keep track of is the current number, so let’s declare a JavaScript object with one property, `count`, in an `x-data` attribute on the div for our counter:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"counter\" x-data=\"{ count: 0 }\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter with Alpine, line 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines our state, that is, the data we are going to be using to drive dynamic updates to the DOM. With the state declared like this, we can now use it _within_ the div element it is declared on. Let’s add an `output` element with an `x-text` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will _bind_ the `x-text` attribute to the `count` attribute we declared in the `x-data` attribute on the parent `div` element. This will have the effect of setting the text of the `output` element to whatever the value of `count` is: if `count` is updated, so will the text of the `output`. This is “reactive” programming, in that the DOM will “react” to changes to the backing data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div x-data=\"{ count: 0 }\">\n",
    "  <output x-text=\"count\"></output> <1>\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. The `x-text` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to update the count, using a button. Alpine allows you to attach event listeners with the `x-on` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the event to listen for, you add a colon and then the event name after the `x-on` attribute name. Then, the value of the attribute is the JavaScript you wish to execute. This is similar to the plain `on*` attributes we discussed earlier, but it turns out to be much more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to listen for a `click` event, and we want to increment `count` when a click occurs, so here is what the Alpine code will look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div x-data=\"{ count: 0 }\">\n",
    "  <output x-text=\"count\"></output>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <button x-on:click=\"count++\">Increment</button> <1>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter with Alpine, the full thing\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. With `x-on`, we specify the event in the attribute _name_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s all it takes. A simple component like a counter should be simple to code, and Alpine delivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### “x-on:click” vs. “onclick”\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said, the Alpine `x-on:click` attribute (or its shorthand, the `@click` attribute) is similar to the built-in `onclick` attribute. However, it has additional features that make it significantly more useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You can listen for events from other elements. For example, the `.outside` modifier lets you listen to any click event that is _not_ within the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You can use other modifiers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * throttle or debounce event listeners\n",
    "\n",
    "    * ignore events that are bubbled up from descendant elements\n",
    "\n",
    "    * attach passive listeners\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You can listen to custom events. For example, if you wanted to listen for the `htmx:after-request` event you could write `x-on:htmx:after-request=\"doSomething()\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reactivity and Templating\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you’ll agree that the AlpineJS version of the counter widget is better, in general, than the VanillaJS implementation, which was either somewhat hacky or spread out over multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of the power of AlpineJS is that it supports a notion of “reactive” variables, allowing you to bind the count of the `div` element to a variable that both the `output` and the `button` can reference, and properly updating all the dependencies when a mutation occurs. Alpine allows for much more elaborate data bindings than we have demonstrated here, and it is an excellent general purpose client-side scripting library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alpine.js in Action: A Bulk Action Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s implement a feature in Contact.app with Alpine. As it stands currently, Contact.app has a “Delete Selected Contacts” button at the very bottom of the page. This button has a long name, is not easy to find and takes up a lot of room. If we wanted to add additional “bulk” actions, this wouldn’t scale well visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll replace this single button with a toolbar. Furthermore, the toolbar will only appear when the user starts selecting contacts. Finally, it will show how many contacts are selected and let you select all contacts in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will need to add is an `x-data` attribute, to hold the state that we will use to determine if the toolbar is visible or not. We will need to place this on an ancestor element of both the toolbar that we are going to add, as well as the checkboxes, which will be updating the state when they are checked and unchecked. The best option given our current HTML is to place the attribute on the `form` element that surrounds the contacts table. We will declare a property, `selected`, which will be an array that holds the selected contact ids, based on the checkboxes that are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our form tag will look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<form x-data=\"{ selected: [] }\"> <1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. This form wraps around the contacts table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, at the top of the contacts table, we are going to add a `template` tag. A template tag is _not_ rendered by a browser, by default, so you might be surprised that we are using it. However, by adding an Alpine `x-if` attribute, we can tell Alpine: if a condition is true, show the HTML within this template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we want to show the toolbar if and only if one or more contacts are selected. But we know that we will have the ids of the selected contacts in the `selected` property. Therefore, we can check the _length_ of that array to see if there are any selected contacts, quite easily:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<template x-if=\"selected.length > 0\"> <1>\n",
    "  <div class=\"box info tool-bar\">\n",
    "    <slot x-text=\"selected.length\"></slot>\n",
    "    contacts selected\n",
    "\n",
    "    <button type=\"button\" class=\"bad bg color border\">Delete</button> <2>\n",
    "    <hr aria-orientation=\"vertical\">\n",
    "    <button type=\"button\">Cancel</button> <2>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</template>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Show this HTML if there are 1 or more selected contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. We will implement these buttons in just a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to ensure that toggling a checkbox for a given contact adds (or removes) a given contact’s id from the `selected` property. To do this, we will need to use a new Alpine attribute, `x-model`. The `x-model` attribute allows you to _bind_ a given element to some underlying data, or its “model.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to bind the value of the checkbox inputs to the `selected` property. This is how we do this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<td>\n",
    "  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"selected_contact_ids\"\n",
    "    value=\"{{ contact.id }}\" x-model=\"selected\"> <1>\n",
    "</td>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The `x-model` attribute binds the `value` of this input to the `selected` property\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a checkbox is checked or unchecked, the `selected` array will be updated with the given row’s contact id. Furthermore, mutations we make to the `selected` array will similarly be reflected in the checkboxes” state. This is known as a _two-way_ binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this code written, we can make the toolbar appear and disappear, based on whether contact checkboxes are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very slick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, you may have noticed our code here includes some “class=” references. These are for css styling, and are not part of Alpine.js. We’ve included them only as a reminder that the menu bar we’re building will require css to work well. The classes in the code above refer to a minimal css library called Missing.css. If you use other css libraries, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, Pico.css, etc., your styling code will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the mechanics of showing and hiding the toolbar, let’s look at how to implement the buttons within the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first implement the “Clear” button, because it is quite easy. All we need to do is, when the button is clicked, clear out the `selected` array. Because of the two-way binding that Alpine provides, this will uncheck all the selected contacts (and then hide the toolbar)!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the _Cancel_ button, our job is simple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button type=\"button\" @click=\"selected = []\">Cancel</button> <1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Reset the `selected` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, AlpineJS makes this very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Delete” button, however, will be a bit more complicated. It will need to do two things: first it will confirm if the user indeed intends to delete the contacts selected. Then, if the user confirms the action, it will use the htmx JavaScript API to issue a `DELETE` request.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button type=\"button\" class=\"bad bg color border\"\n",
    "  @click=\"\n",
    "    confirm(`Delete ${selected.length} contacts?`) && <1>\n",
    "    htmx.ajax('DELETE', '/contacts',\n",
    "      { source: $root, target: document.body }) <2>\n",
    "  \">\n",
    "  Delete\n",
    "</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Confirm the user wishes to delete the selected number of contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Issue a `DELETE` using the htmx JavaScript API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are using the short-circuiting behavior of the `&&` operator in JavaScript to avoid the call to `htmx.ajax()` if the `confirm()` call returns false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `htmx.ajax()` function is just a way to access the normal, HTML-driven hypermedia exchange that htmx’s HTML attributes give you directly from JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at how we call `htmx.ajax`, we first pass in that we want to issue a `DELETE` to `/contacts`. We then pass in two additional pieces of information: `source` and `target`. The `source` property is the element from which htmx will collect data to include in the request. We set this to `$root`, which is a special symbol in Alpine that will be the element that has the `x-data` attribute declared on it. In this case, it will be the form containing all of our contacts. The `target`, or where the response HTML will be placed, is just the entire document’s body, since the `DELETE` handler returns a whole page when it completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are using Alpine here in a Hypermedia-Driven Application compatible manner. We _could_ have issued an AJAX request directly from Alpine and perhaps updated an `x-data` property depending on the results of that request. But, instead, we delegated to htmx’s JavaScript API, which made a _hypermedia exchange_ with the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key to scripting in a hypermedia-friendly manner within a Hypermedia-Driven Application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with all of this in place, we now have a much improved experience for performing bulk actions on contacts: less visual clutter and the toolbar can be extended with more options without creating bloat in the main interface of our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## _hyperscript\n",
    "\n",
    "The final scripting technology we are going to look at is a bit further afield: [_hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org). The authors of this book initially created _hyperscript as a sibling project to htmx. We felt that JavaScript wasn’t event-oriented enough, which made adding small scripting enhancements to htmx applications cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous two examples are JavaScript-oriented, _hyperscript has a completely different syntax than JavaScript, based on an older language called HyperTalk. HyperTalk was the scripting language for a technology called HyperCard, an old hypermedia system available on early Macintosh Computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most noticeable thing about _hyperscript is that it resembles English prose more than it resembles other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Alpine, _hyperscript is a modern jQuery replacement. Also like Alpine, _hyperscript allows you to write your scripting inline, in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Alpine, however, _hyperscript is _not_ reactive. It instead focuses on making DOM manipulations in response to events easy to write and easy to read. It has built-in language constructs for many DOM operations, preventing you from needing to navigate the sometimes-verbose JavaScript DOM APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give a small taste of what scripting in the _hyperscript language is like, so you can pursue the language in more depth later if you find it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like htmx and AlpineJS, _hyperscript can be installed via a CDN or from npm (package name `hyperscript.org`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script src=\"//unpkg.com/hyperscript.org\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing _hyperscript via CDN\n",
    "\n",
    "_hyperscript uses the `_` (underscore) attribute for putting scripting on DOM elements. You may also use the `script` or `data-script` attributes, depending on your HTML validation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at how to implement the simple counter component we have been looking at using _hyperscript. We will place an `output` element and a `button` inside of a `div`. To implement the counter, we will need to add a small bit of _hyperscript to the button. On a click, the button should increment the text of the previous `output` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’ll see, that last sentence is close to the actual _hyperscript code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"counter\">\n",
    "  <output>0</output>\n",
    "  <button _=\"on click\n",
    "    increment the textContent of the previous <output/>\"> <1>\n",
    "    Increment\n",
    "  </button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The _hyperscript code added inline to the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through each component of this script:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `on click` is an event listener, telling the button to listen for a `click` event and then executing the remaining code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `increment` is a “command” in _hyperscript that “increments” things, similar to the `++` operator in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `the` doesn’t have any semantic meaning in _hyperscript, but can be used to make scripts more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `textContent of` is one form of _property access_ in _hyperscript. You are probably familiar with the JavaScript syntax `a.b`, meaning “Get the property `b` on object `a`. _hyperscript supports this syntax, but also supports the forms `b of a` and `a’s b`. Which one you use should depend on which one is most readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `previous` is an expression in _hyperscript that finds the previous element in the DOM that matches some condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `<output />` is a _query literal_ , which is a CSS selector wrapped between `<` and `/>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `previous` keyword (and the accompanying `next` keyword) is an example of how _hyperscript makes DOM operations easier: there is no such native functionality to be found in the standard DOM API, and implementing this in VanillaJS is trickier than you might think!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can see, _hyperscript is very expressive, particularly when it comes to DOM manipulations. This makes it easier to embed scripts directly in HTML: since the scripting language is more powerful, scripts written in it tend to be shorter and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Programming?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasoned programmers may be suspicious of _hyperscript: There have been many “natural language programming” (NLP) projects that target non-programmers and beginner programmers, assuming that being able to read code in their “natural language” will give them the ability to write it as well. This has led to some badly written and structured code and has failed to live up to the (often over the top) hype.\n",
    "\n",
    "_hyperscript is _not_ an NLP programming language. Yes, its syntax is inspired in many places by the speech patterns of web developers. But _hyperscript’s readability is achieved not through complex heuristics or fuzzy NLP processing, but rather through judicious use of common parsing tricks, coupled with a culture of readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the above example, with the use of a _query reference_ , `<output/>`, _hyperscript does not shy away from using DOM-specific, non-natural language when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _hyperscript in Action: A Keyboard Shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "While the counter demo is a good way to compare various approaches to scripting, the rubber meets the road when you try to actually implement a useful feature with an approach. For _hyperscript, let’s add a keyboard shortcut to Contact.app: when a user hits Alt+S in our app, we will focus the search field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our keyboard shortcut focuses the search input, let’s put the code for it on that search input, satisfying locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the original HTML for the search input:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<input id=\"search\" name=\"q\" type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search Contacts\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add an event listener using the `on keydown` syntax, which will fire whenever a keydown occurs. Further, we can use an _event filter_ syntax in _hyperscript using square brackets after the event. In the square brackets we can place a _filter expression_ that will filter out `keydown` events we aren’t interested in. In our case, we only want to consider events where the Alt key is held down and where the “S” key is being pressed. We can create a boolean expression that inspects the `altKey` property (to see if it is `true`) and the `code` property (to see if it is `\"KeyS\"`) of the event to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far our _hyperscript looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "on keydown[altKey and code is 'KeyS'] ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A start on our keyboard shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by default, _hyperscript will listen for a given event _on the element where it is declared_. So, with the script we have, we would only get `keydown` events if the search box is already focused. That’s not what we want! We want to have this key work _globally_ , no matter which element has focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a problem! We can listen for the `keyDown` event elsewhere by using a `from` clause in our event handler. In this case we want to listen for the `keyDown` from the window, and our code ends up looking, naturally, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "on keydown[altKey and code is 'KeyS'] from window ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Listening globally\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `from` clause, we can attach the listener to the window while, at the same time, keeping the code on the element it logically relates to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve picked out the event we want to use to focus the search box, let’s implement the actual focusing by calling the standard `.focus()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the entire script, embedded in HTML:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<input id=\"search\" name=\"q\" type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search Contacts\"\n",
    "  _=\"on keydown[altKey and code is 'KeyS'] from the window\n",
    "    focus() me\"> <1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final script\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. “me” refers to the element that the script is written on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all the functionality, this is surprisingly terse, and, as an English-like programming language, pretty easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a New Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all well and good, but you may be thinking “An entirely new scripting language? That seems excessive.” And, at some level, you are right: JavaScript is a decent scripting language, is very well optimized and is widely understood in web development. On the other hand, by creating an entirely new front end scripting language, we had the freedom to address some problems that we saw generating ugly and verbose code in JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "Async transparency\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In _hyperscript, asynchronous functions (i.e., functions that return `Promise` instances) can be invoked _as if they were synchronous_. Changing a function from sync to async does not break any _hyperscript code that calls it. This is achieved by checking for a Promise when evaluating any expression, and suspending the running script if one exists (only the current event handler is suspended and the main thread is not blocked). JavaScript, instead, requires either the explicit use of callbacks _or_ the use of explicit `async` annotations (which can’t be mixed with synchronous code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Array property access\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In _hyperscript, accessing a property on an array (other than `length` or a number) will return an array of the values of property on each member of that array, making array property access act like a flat-map operation. jQuery has a similar feature, but only for its own data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native CSS Syntax\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In _hyperscript, you can use things like CSS class and ID literals, or CSS query literals, directly in the language, rather than needing to call out to a wordy DOM API, as you do in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Event Support\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Working with events in _hyperscript is far more pleasant than working with them in JavaScript, with native support for responding to and sending events, as well as for common event-handling patterns such as “debouncing” or rate limiting events. _hyperscript also provides declarative mechanisms for synchronizing events within a given element and across multiple elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we wish to stress that, in this example, we are not stepping outside the lines of a Hypermedia-Driven Application: we are only adding frontend, client-side functionality with our scripting. We are not creating and managing a large amount of state outside of the DOM itself, or communicating with the server in a non-hypermedia exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since _hyperscript embeds so well in HTML, it keeps the focus _on the hypermedia_ , rather than on the scripting logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not fit all scripting styles or needs, but _hyperscript can provide an excellent scripting experience for Hypermedia-Driven Applications. It is a small and obscure programming language worth a look to understand what it is trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Off-the-Shelf Components\n",
    "\n",
    "That concludes our look at three different options for _your_ scripting infrastructure, that is, the code that _you_ write to enhance your Hypermedia-Driven Application. However, there is another major area to consider when discussing client side scripting: “off the shelf” components. That is, JavaScript libraries that other people have created that offer some sort of functionality, such as showing modal dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components have become very popular in the web development world, with libraries like [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) providing rich user experiences with very little JavaScript code on the part of a user. Unfortunately, if these libraries aren’t integrated well into a website, they can begin to make an application feel “patched together.” Furthermore, some libraries go beyond simple DOM manipulation, and require that you integrate with a server endpoint, almost invariably with a JSON data API. This means you are no longer building a Hypermedia-Driven Application, simply because a particular widget demands something different. A shame!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Components is the collective name of a few standards; Custom Elements and Shadow DOM, and `<template>` and `<slot>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these standards bring useful capabilities to the table. `<template>` elements remove their contents from the document, while still parsing them as HTML (unlike comments) and making them accessible to JavaScript. Custom Elements let us initialize and tear down behaviors when elements are added or removed, which would previously require manual work or MutationObservers. Shadow DOM lets us encapsulate elements, leaving the “light” (non-shadow) DOM clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, trying to reap these benefits is often frustrating. Some difficulties are simply growing pains of new standards (like the accessibility problems of Shadow DOM) that are actively being worked on. Others are the result of Web Components trying to be too many things at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An extension mechanism for HTML. To this end, each custom element is a tag we add to the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A lifecycle mechanism for behaviors. Methods like `createdCallback`, `connectedCallback`, etc. allow behavior to be added to elements without needing to be manually invoked when those elements are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A unit of encapsulation. Shadow DOM insulates elements from their surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The result is that if you want any one of these things, the others come along for the ride. If you want to attach some behaviors to some elements using lifecycle callbacks, you need to create a new tag, which means you can’t have multiple behaviors on one element, and you isolate elements you add from elements already in the page, which is a problem if they need to have ARIA relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "When should we use Web Components? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself: “Could this reasonably be a built-in HTML element?” For example, a code editor is a good candidate, since HTML already has `<textarea>` and `contenteditable` elements. In addition, a fully-featured code editor will have many child elements that won’t provide much information anyway. We can use features like [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate these elements2. We can create a [custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), `<code-area>`, that we can drop into our page whenever we want.\n",

    "### Integration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The best JavaScript libraries to work with when you are building a Hypermedia-Driven Application are ones that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Mutate the DOM but don’t communicate with a server over JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Respect HTML norms (e.g., using `input` elements to store values)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Trigger many custom events as the library updates things\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point, triggering many custom events (over the alternative of using lots of methods and callbacks) is especially important, as these custom events can be dispatched or listened to without additional glue code written in a scripting language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at two different approaches to scripting, one using JavaScript call backs, and one using events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things concrete, let’s implement a better confirmation dialog for the `DELETE` button we created in Alpine in the previous section. In the original example we used the `confirm()` function built in to JavaScript, which shows a pretty bare-bones system confirmation dialog. We will replace this function with a popular JavaScript library, SweetAlert2, that shows a much nicer looking confirmation dialog. Unlike the `confirm()` function, which blocks and returns a boolean (`true` if the user confirmed, `false` otherwise), SweetAlert2 returns a `Promise` object, which is a JavaScript mechanism for hooking in a callback once an asynchronous action (such as waiting for a user to confirm or deny an action) completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating using callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "With SweetAlert2 installed as a library, you have access to the `Swal` object, which has a `fire()` function on it to trigger showing an alert. You can pass in arguments to the `fire()` method to configure exactly what the buttons on the confirmation dialog look like, what the title of the dialog is, and so forth. We won’t get into these details too much, but you will see what a dialog looks like in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given we have installed the SweetAlert2 library, we can swap it in place of the `confirm()` function call. We then need to restructure the code to pass a _callback_ to the `then()` method on the `Promise` that `Swal.fire()` returns. A deep dive into Promises is beyond the scope of this chapter, but suffice to say that this callback will be called when a user confirms or denies the action. If the user confirmed the action, then the `result.isConfirmed` property will be `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all that, our updated code will look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button type=\"button\" class=\"bad bg color border\"\n",
    "  @click=\"Swal.fire({ <1>\n",
    "    title: 'Delete these contacts?', <2>\n",
    "    showCancelButton: true,\n",
    "    confirmButtonText: 'Delete'\n",
    "  }).then((result) => { <3>\n",
    "    if (result.isConfirmed) htmx.ajax('DELETE', '/contacts',\n",
    "        { source: $root, target: document.body })\n",
    "  });\"\n",
    ">Delete</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A callback-based confirmation dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Invoke the `Swal.fire()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Configure the dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Handle the result of the user’s selection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, when this button is clicked, we get a nice looking dialog in our web application ([fig-swal-screenshot]) — much nicer than the system confirmation dialog. Still, this feels a little wrong. This is a lot of code to write just to trigger a slightly nicer `confirm()`, isn’t it? And the htmx JavaScript code we are using here feels awkward. It would be more natural to move the htmx out to attributes on the button, as we have been doing, and then trigger the request via events.\n",

    "A SweetAlert dialog box\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s take a different approach and see how that looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating using events\n",
    "\n",
    "To clean this code up, we will pull the `Swal.fire()` code out to a custom JavaScript function we will create called `sweetConfirm()`. `sweetConfirm()` will take the dialog options that are passed into the `fire()` method, as well as the element that is confirming an action. The big difference here is that the new `sweetConfirm()` function, rather than calling some htmx directly, will instead trigger a `confirmed` event on the button when the user confirms they wish to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our JavaScript function looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function sweetConfirm(elt, config) {\n",
    "  Swal.fire(config) <1>\n",
    "    .then((result) => {\n",
    "      if (result.isConfirmed) {\n",
    "        elt.dispatchEvent(new Event('confirmed')); <2>\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An event-based confirmation dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Pass the config through to the `fire()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. If the user confirmed the action, trigger a `confirmed` event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this method available, we can now tighten up our delete button quite a bit. We can remove all the SweetAlert2 code that we had in the `@click` Alpine attribute, and simply call this new `sweetConfirm()` method, passing in the arguments `$el`, which is the Alpine syntax for getting “the current element” that the script is on, and then the exact configuration we want for our dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user confirms the action, a `confirmed` event will be triggered on the button. This means that we can go back to using our trusty htmx attributes! Namely, we can move `DELETE` to an `hx-delete` attribute, and we can use `hx-target` to target the body. And then, and here is the crucial step, we can use the `confirmed` event that is triggered in the `sweetConfirm()` function, to trigger the request, but adding an `hx-trigger` for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our code looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button type=\"button\" class=\"bad bg color border\"\n",
    "  hx-delete=\"/contacts\" hx-target=\"body\" hx-trigger=\"confirmed\" <1>\n",
    "  @click=\"sweetConfirm($el, { <2>\n",
    "    title: 'Delete these contacts?', <3>\n",
    "    showCancelButton: true,\n",
    "    confirmButtonText: 'Delete'\n",
    "  })\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An Event-based Confirmation Dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Our htmx attributes are back.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. We pass the button in to the function, so an event can be triggered on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. We pass through the SweetAlert2 configuration information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this event-based code is much cleaner and certainly more “HTML-ish.” The key to this cleaner implementation is that our new `sweetConfirm()` function fires an event that htmx is able to listen for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why a rich event model is important to look for when choosing a library to work with, both with htmx and with Hypermedia-Driven Applications in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to the prevalence and dominance of the JavaScript-first mindset today, many libraries are like SweetAlert2: they expect you to pass a callback in the first style. In these cases you can use the technique we have demonstrated here, wrapping the library in a function that triggers events in a callback, to make the library more hypermedia and htmx-friendly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes you might even consider picking two (or more) of these approaches within an application. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and all of them are relatively small and self-contained, so picking the right tool for the job at hand might be the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we encourage a _pragmatic_ approach to scripting: whatever feels right is probably right (or, at least, right _enough_) for you. Rather than being concerned about which particular approach is taken for your scripting, we would focus on these more general concerns:\n",
