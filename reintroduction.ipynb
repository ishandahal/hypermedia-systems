    "1. **REST Misuse Clarified**: Fielding's REST described the 1990s web (browsers exchanging HTML). Modern \"REST\" for JSON APIs misapplies the term — JSON lacks hypermedia controls. Current JSON APIs may be *stateless* (one REST principle) but aren't *hypermedia-driven* (the core principle - HATEOAS: Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State).\n",

    "2. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps that actually use the hypermedia capabilities of the underlying system, contrasted with SPAs which bypass them.\n",

    "   - Part 1: HTML, HTTP fundamentals → build \"Web 1.0\" Contact.app\n",
    "   - Part 2: Enhance with **htmx** (hypermedia-oriented JS library)\n",
    "   - Part 3: **Hyperview** (mobile hypermedia system)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HTML Note**: Good HTML serves the whole hypermedia system — browsers, screen readers, search engines, developers. Let browsers do the work.\n",

    "Hypermedia is a universal technology today, almost as common as electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Billions of people use hypermedia-based systems every day, mainly by interacting with the _Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)_ being exchanged via the _Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)_ by using a web browser connected to the World Wide Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "People use these systems to get their news, check in on friends, buy things online, play games, send emails and so forth: the variety and sheer number of online services being delivered by hypermedia is truly astonishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, despite this ubiquity, the topic of hypermedia itself is a strangely under-explored concept today, left mainly to specialists. Yes, you can find a lot of tutorials on how to author HTML, create links and forms, etc. But it is rare to see a discussion of HTML _as a hypermedia_ and, more broadly, on how an entire hypermedia _system_ fits together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast with the early web development era when concepts like _Representational State Transfer (REST)_ and _Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)_ were discussed frequently, refined and debated among web developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sad turn of events, today, the world’s most popular hypermedia, HTML, is often viewed resentfully: it is an awkward, legacy markup language that must be grudgingly used to build user interfaces in what are increasingly entirely JavaScript-based web applications.\n",

    "HTML happens to be there, in the browser, and so we have to use it.\n",

Instead, we aim to show you that hypermedia is a tremendously innovative, simple and _flexible_ way to build robust applications: _Hypermedia-Driven Applications_.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us begin at the beginning: what is hypermedia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypermedia is a media, for example a text, that includes _non-linear branching_ from one location in the media to another, via, for example, hyperlinks embedded in the media. The prefix “hyper-” derives from the Greek prefix “ὑπερ-” which means “beyond” or “over”, indicating that hypermedia _goes beyond_ normal, passively consumed media like magazines and newspapers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperlinks are a canonical example of what is called a _hypermedia control_ :\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypermedia Control\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A hypermedia control is an element in a hypermedia that describes (or controls) some sort of interaction, often with a remote server, by encoding information about that interaction directly and completely within itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypermedia controls are what differentiate hypermedia from other sorts of media.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be more familiar with the term _hypertext_ , from whose Wikipedia page the above quote is taken. Hypertext is a sub-category of hypermedia and much of this book is going to discuss how to build modern applications using hypertexts such as HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, or HXML, a hypertext used by the Hyperview mobile hypermedia system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypertexts like HTML function alongside other technologies crucial for making an entire hypermedia system work: network protocols like HTTP, other media types such as images and videos, hypermedia servers (i.e., servers providing hypermedia APIs), sophisticated hypermedia clients (e.g., web browsers), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we prefer the broader term _hypermedia systems_ when describing the underlying architecture of applications built using hypertext, to emphasize the system architecture over the particular hypermedia being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the entire hypermedia _system architecture_ that is underappreciated and ignored by many modern web developers.\n",

    "**Core Definition:**\n",
    "- Hypermedia is media with *non-linear branching* (like hyperlinks) — it \"goes beyond\" passive media like newspapers\n",
    "- A **hypermedia control** is the key differentiator: an element that encodes interaction information *directly and completely within itself*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Current Situation (a bit sad!):**\n",
    "- Despite billions using hypermedia daily, the *concept itself* is under-explored\n",
    "- HTML is often viewed \"resentfully\" as legacy tech we're stuck with, rather than appreciated for what it offers\n",
    "- Early web discussions about REST and HATEOAS have faded\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Book's Argument:**\n",
    "- Hypermedia is actually innovative, simple, and flexible\n",
    "- Building *Hypermedia-Driven Applications* deserves serious consideration for modern apps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worth Digging Into:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Encodes information directly and completely within itself\"** — This is a crucial phrase. How does a hyperlink contain *everything* needed for the interaction? (Compare this to, say, a JSON API where the client must know separately what to do with the data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hypermedia *system*** — They emphasize we should think about the whole architecture (HTML + HTTP + browsers + servers), not just the markup. Why does that matter?\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about a simple HTML link:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<a href=\"/contacts/42\">View Contact</a>\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **How** to get there (it's an `<a>` tag, so the browser knows to use HTTP GET)\n",
    "- **What** triggers it (clicking)\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser doesn't need a separate instruction manual. It sees this element and *already knows* how to handle the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now contrast this with a typical JSON API response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"id\": 42, \"name\": \"Alice\", \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"}\n",
    "```\n",

    "Consider what's involved when you click a link:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTML** — contains the hypermedia control (the link)\n",

    "4. **Server** — returns a *new* hypermedia document (not just data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each piece has a role, and they work together seamlessly. The browser handles caching, the protocol handles headers and status codes, HTML handles the UI and controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "When developers treat HTML as \"just a rendering target\" for JavaScript, they often end up *reimplementing* what the browser already does — routing, history management, form validation, loading indicators...\n",

    "Where did the idea of hypermedia come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there were many precursors to the modern idea of hypertext and the more general hypermedia, many people point to the 1945 article _As We May Think_ written by Vannevar Bush in _The Atlantic_ as a starting point for looking at what has become modern hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article Bush described a device called a Memex, which, using a complex mechanical system of reels and microfilm, along with an encoding system, would allow users to jump between related frames of content. The Memex was never actually implemented, but it was an inspiration for later work on the idea of hypermedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms “hypertext” and “hypermedia” were coined in 1963 by Ted Nelson, who would go on to work on the _Hypertext Editing System_ at Brown University and who later created the _File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS)_ , a shockingly advanced hypermedia system for its time. (This was perhaps the first digital system to have a notion of “undo”.)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Nelson was working on his ideas, Douglas Engelbart was busy at work at the Stanford Research Institute, explicitly attempting to make Vannevar Bush’s Memex a reality. In 1968, Englebart gave “The Mother of All Demos” in San Francisco, California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Englebart demonstrated an unbelievable amount of technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Remote, collaborative text editing with his peers in Menlo Park\n",

    "  * Video and audio chat\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An integrated windowing system, with window resizing, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A recognizable hypertext, whereby clicking on underlined text navigated to new content.\n",
    "\n",

    "In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN, published the first website. He had been working on the idea of hypertext for a decade and had finally, out of desperation at the fact it was so hard for researchers to share their research, found the right moment and institutional support to create the World Wide Web:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.\n",

    " Tim Berners-Lee, https://britishheritage.org/tim-berners-lee-the-world-wide-web\n",

All standards created by the W3C were royalty-free and could be adopted and implemented by anyone, cementing the open, collaborative nature of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Roy Fielding, then at U.C. Irvine, published a seminal PhD dissertation on the web: “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures.” Fielding had been working on the open source Apache HTTP Server and his thesis was a description of what he felt was a _new and distinct networking architecture_ that had emerged in the early web. Fielding had worked on the initial HTTP specifications and, in the paper, defined the web’s hypermedia network model using the term _REpresentational State Transfer (REST)_.\n",

    "\n",
    "He looked at the early web (browsers requesting HTML pages via HTTP) and asked: *why does this work so well?* He identified the architectural principles that made it successful and gave them a name: **REST** (REpresentational State Transfer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click a link, the server sends you a *representation* of a resource (an HTML page). That representation contains everything you need — the content *and* the controls (links, forms) to take further action. Each response transfers a new \"state\" of the application to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence: *Representational State Transfer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Fielding named it, people were building on the web without a clear vocabulary for *why* certain approaches worked better than others. His dissertation gave developers a framework to reason about web architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Irony (touched on in the Introduction):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Today \"REST\" usually means \"JSON API with nice URLs\" — which actually *violates* Fielding's core principle! JSON responses typically don't include hypermedia controls telling you what to do next.\n",

    "\n",
    "So links and forms are the two main hypermedia-based mechanisms for interacting with a server available in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s consider a different approach: let’s interact with a server by issuing an HTTP request via JavaScript. To do this, we will use the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API, a popular API for issuing an “Asynchronous JavaScript and XML,” or AJAX request, available in all modern web browsers:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    <button onclick=\"fetch('/api/v1/contacts/1') <1>\n",
    "                    .then(response => response.json()) <2>\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. Issue the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Convert the response to a JavaScript object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Invoke the `updateUI()` function with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This button has an `onclick` attribute that specifies some JavaScript to run when the button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaScript will issue an AJAX HTTP `GET` request to `/api/v1/contacts/1` using `fetch()`. An AJAX request is like a “normal” HTTP request, but it is issued “behind the scenes” by the browser. The user does not see a request indicator from the browser as they would with normal links and forms. Additionally, unlike requests issued by those hypermedia controls, it is up to the JavaScript code to handle the response from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite AJAX having XML as part of its acronym, today the HTTP response to this request would almost certainly be in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format rather than XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP response to this request might look something like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    { <1>\n",
    "      \"id\": 42, <2>\n",

    "\n",
    "  3. Another property, the email of the contact with this id.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaScript code above converts the JSON text received from the server into a JavaScript object by calling the `json()` method on it. This new JavaScript object is then handed off to the `updateUI()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `updateUI()` method is responsible for updating the UI based on the data encoded in the JavaScript Object, perhaps by displaying the contact in a bit of HTML generated via a client-side template in the JavaScript application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of exactly what the `updateUI()` function does aren’t important for our discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "What _is_ important, what is the _crucial_ aspect of this JSON-based server interaction is that it is _not_ using hypermedia. The JSON API being used here does not return a hypermedia response. There are no _hyperlinks_ or other hypermedia-style controls in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This JSON API is, rather, a _Data API_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the response is in JSON and is _not_ hypermedia, the JavaScript `updateUI()` method must understand how to turn this contact data into HTML.\n",

    "\n",

As a result, the `updateUI()` code and the API have a strong relationship, known as _tight coupling_ : if the format of the JSON response changes, then the code for `updateUI()` will almost certainly also need to be changed as well.\n",

    "#### Single Page Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This bit of JavaScript, while very modest, is the organic beginnings of a much larger conceptual approach to building web applications. This is the beginning of a _Single Page Application (SPA)_. The web application is no longer navigating _between_ pages using hypermedia controls as was the case with links and forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the application is exchanging _plain data_ with the server and then updating the content _within_ a single page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this strategy or architecture is adopted for an entire application, everything happens on a “Single Page” and, thus the application becomes a “Single Page Application.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single Page Application architecture is extremely popular today and has been the dominant approach to building web applications for the last decade. This can be observed by the high level of mind-share and discussion it has received in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today the vast majority of Single Page Applications adopt far more sophisticated frameworks for managing their user interface than this simple example shows. Popular libraries such as React, Angular, Vue.js, etc. are now the common — indeed, the standard — way to build web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these more complex frameworks developers typically work with an elaborate client-side model — that is, with JavaScript objects stored locally in the browser’s memory that represent the “model” or “domain” of your application. These JavaScript objects are updated via JavaScript code and the framework then “reacts” to these changes, updating the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user interface is updated by a user these changes also flow _into_ the model objects, establishing a “two-way” binding mechanism: the model can update the UI, and the UI can update the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a much more sophisticated approach to a web client than hypermedia, and it typically does away almost entirely with the underlying hypermedia infrastructure available in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is still used to build user interfaces, but the _hypermedia_ aspect of the two major hypermedia controls, anchors and forms, are unused. Neither tag interacts with a server via their native _hypermedia_ mechanism. Rather, they become user interface elements that drive local interactions with the in-memory domain model via JavaScript, which is then synchronized with the server using plain data JSON APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as with our simple button above, the Single Page Application approach foregoes the hypermedia architecture. It leaves aside the advantages of the existing RESTful architecture of the web and the built-in functionality found in HTML’s native hypermedia controls in favor of JavaScript driven behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "SPAs are much more like _thick client applications_ , that is, like the client-server applications of the 1980s — an architecture popular _before_ the web came along and that the web was, in many ways, a reaction to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach isn’t necessarily wrong, of course: there are times when a thick client approach is the appropriate choice for an application. But it is worth thinking about _why_ web developers so frequently make this choice without considering other alternatives, and if there are reasons _not_ to go down this path.\n",

    "The JavaScript-based Single Page Application approach has taken the web development world by storm, and if there was one single reason for its wild success it was this: The Single Page Application offers a far more interactive and immersive experience than the old, gronky, Web 1.0 hypermedia-based applications could. SPAs had the ability to smoothly update elements inline on a page without a dramatic reload of the entire document, they had the ability to use CSS transitions to create nice visual effects, and the ability to hook into arbitrary events like mouse movements.\n",

    "Good observation! Both use caching, but for *different things* with *different implications*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPA caching:**\n",
    "- Caches the JavaScript bundle (the app code)\n",
    "- Once cached, you skip re-downloading the app\n",
    "- But: the *data* (JSON from APIs) often isn't cached, or caching it is complicated (stale data problems, cache invalidation logic)\n",
    "- You also need to re-execute all that JS each visit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypermedia caching:**\n",
    "- Caches *entire HTML pages* or fragments\n",
    "- HTTP has built-in, mature caching mechanisms (ETags, Cache-Control headers)\n",
    "- Browser and intermediate proxies/CDNs can cache responses automatically\n",
    "- Server can say \"this page hasn't changed\" (304 Not Modified) — browser uses cached version, very fast\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "With hypermedia, caching is *baked into the architecture* — HTTP and browsers have decades of optimization for this. With SPAs, you often end up building your own caching layer in JavaScript for your API data, which adds complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, both cache things — but hypermedia leverages the *full* caching infrastructure of the web, while SPAs mainly cache the app code and then manage data caching separately (and often with more effort).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two major reasons hypermedia hasn’t made a comeback in web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is this: the expressiveness of HTML _as a hypermedia_ hasn’t changed much, if at all, since HTML 2.0, which was released _in the mid 1990s_. Many new _features_ have been added to HTML, of course, but there haven’t been _any_ major new ways to interact with a server in HTML in almost three decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML developers still only have anchor tags and forms available as hypermedia controls, and those hypermedia controls can still only issue `GET` and `POST` requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This baffling lack of progress by HTML leads immediately to the second, and perhaps more practical reason that HTML-as-hypermedia has fallen on hard times: as the interactivity and expressiveness of HTML has remained frozen, the demands of web users have continued to increase, calling for more and more interactive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript-based applications coupled to data-oriented JSON APIs have stepped in as a way to provide these more sophisticated user interfaces. It was the _user experience_ that you could achieve in JavaScript, and that you couldn’t achieve in plain HTML, that drove the web development community to the JavaScript-based Single Page Application approach. The shift was not driven by any inherent superiority of the Single Page Application as a system architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "It didn’t have to be this way. There is nothing _intrinsic_ to the idea of hypermedia that prevents it from having a richer, more expressive interactivity model than vanilla HTML. Rather than moving away from a hypermedia-based approach, the industry could have demanded more interactivity from HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, building thick-client style applications within web browsers became the standard, in an understandable move to a more familiar model for building rich applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone set aside hypermedia, of course. There have been heroic efforts to continue to advance hypermedia outside of HTML, efforts like HyTime, VoiceXML, and HAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "But HTML, the most widely used hypermedia in the world, stopped making progress as a hypermedia. The web development world moved on, solving the interactivity problems with HTML by adopting JavaScript-based SPAs and, mostly inadvertently, a completely different system architecture."

    "### Hypermedia-Oriented JavaScript Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the web development world there is an ongoing debate between the Single Page Application (SPA) approach and what is now being called the “Multi-Page Application” (MPA) approach. MPA is a modern name for the old, Web 1.0 way of building web applications, using links and forms located on multiple web pages, submitting HTTP requests and getting HTML responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPA applications, by their nature, are Hypermedia-Driven Applications: after all, they are exactly what Roy Fielding was describing in his dissertation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications tend to be clunky, but they work reasonably well. Many web developers and teams choose to accept the limitations of plain HTML in the interest of simplicity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Harris, creator of Svelte.js, a popular SPA library, and a thought-leader on the SPA side of the debate, has proposed a mix of this older MPA style and the newer SPA style. Harris calls this approach to building web applications “transitional,” in that it attempts to blend the MPA approach and the newer SPA approach into a coherent whole. (This is somewhat similar to the “transitional” trend in architecture, which combines traditional and modern architectural styles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "“Transitional” is a fitting term for mixed-style applications, and it offers a reasonable compromise between the two approaches, using either one as appropriate on a case-by-case basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this compromise still feels unsatisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Must we default to having these two very different architectural models in our applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the crux of the trade-off between SPAs and MPAs is the _user experience_ , or interactivity of the application. This typically drives the decision to choose one approach versus the other for an application or — in the case of a “transitional” application — for a particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that by adopting a hypermedia-oriented library, the interactivity gap between the MPA and the SPA approach closes dramatically. You can use the MPA approach, that is, the hypermedia approach, for much more of your application without compromising your user interface. You might even be able to use the hypermedia approach for _all_ your application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than having an SPA with a bit of hypermedia around the edges, or some mix of the two approaches, you can often create a web application that is _primarily_ or _entirely_ hypermedia-driven, and that still satisfies the interactivity that your users require.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can _tremendously_ simplify your web application and produce a much more coherent and understandable piece of software. While there are still times and places for the more complex SPA approach, which we will discuss later in the book, by adopting a hypermedia-first approach and using a hypermedia-oriented library to push HTML as far as possible, your web application can be powerful, interactive _and_ simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such hypermedia oriented library is [htmx](https://htmx.org). Htmx will be the focus of Part Two of this book. We show that you can, in fact, create many common “modern” UI features found in sophisticated Single Page Applications by instead using the hypermedia model.\n",

    "**Network isn't usually the bottleneck:**\n",
    "- Parsing and executing JavaScript often takes longer than downloading a bit of extra HTML\n",
    "- Browsers are *extremely* optimized for rendering HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching helps a lot:**\n",
    "- Shared page fragments, CSS, images are cached\n",
    "- HTTP compression (gzip) makes HTML very compact over the wire\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"wasteful\" part gets addressed:**\n",
    "- With htmx (coming up!), you don't reload the *whole* page — you can fetch just a *fragment* of HTML and swap it into the page\n",

    "\n",
    "When building a web application with htmx the term Multi-Page Application applies _roughly_ , but it doesn’t fully characterize the core of the application architecture. As you will see, htmx doesn’t _need_ to replace entire pages, and, in fact, an htmx-based application can reside entirely within a single page. We don’t recommend this practice, but it is possible!\n",

    "Therefore, we use the term _Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)_ to describe both.\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "A web application that uses _hypermedia_ and _hypermedia exchanges_ as its primary mechanism for communicating with a server.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let’s look at an htmx-powered implementation of the simple JavaScript-powered button above:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    <button hx-get=\"/contacts/1\" hx-target=\"#contact-ui\"> <1>\n",

    "    </button>\n",
    "\n",
    "An htmx implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. issues a `GET` request to `/contacts/1`, replacing the `contact-ui`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the JavaScript powered button, this button has been annotated with some attributes. However, in this case we do not have any (explicit) JavaScript scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we have _declarative_ attributes much like the `href` attribute on anchor tags and the `action` attribute on form tags. The `hx-get` attribute tells htmx: “When the user clicks this button, issue a `GET` request to `/contacts/1`.” The `hx-target` attribute tells htmx: “When the response returns, take the resulting HTML and place it into the element with the id `contact-ui`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we get to the crux of htmx and how it allows you to build Hypermedia-Driven Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "_The HTTP response from the server is expected to be in HTML format, not JSON_.\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP response to this htmx-driven request might look something like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <details>\n",
    "      <div>\n",
    "        Contact: HTML Example\n",
    "      </div>\n",
    "      <div>\n",
    "        <a href=\"mailto:html-example@example.com\">Email</a>\n",
    "      </div>\n",
    "    </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "This small bit of HTML would be placed into the element in the DOM with the id `contact-ui`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this htmx-powered button is exchanging _hypermedia_ with the server, just like an anchor tag or form might, and thus the interaction is still using the basic hypermedia model of the web. Htmx _is_ adding functionality to this button (via JavaScript), but that functionality is _augmenting_ HTML as a hypermedia. Htmx extends the hypermedia system of the web, rather than _replacing_ that hypermedia system with a totally different architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite looking superficially similar to one another it turns out that this htmx-powered button and the JavaScript-based button are using extremely different system architectures and, thus, approaches to web development.\n",

    "The browser **doesn't** natively understand `hx-get` or `hx-target` — those aren't built-in HTML attributes.\n",

    "Here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You include the **htmx JavaScript library** on your page (a small script)\n",
    "2. When the page loads, htmx scans the HTML for elements with `hx-*` attributes\n",
    "3. htmx attaches event listeners to those elements (like click handlers)\n",
    "4. When triggered, htmx's JavaScript makes the request, gets the HTML response, and swaps it into the target\n",

    "## When Should You Use Hypermedia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypermedia is often, though _not always_ , a great choice for a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you are building a website or application that simply doesn’t _need_ a huge amount of user-interactivity. There are many useful web applications like this, and there is no shame in it! Applications like Amazon, eBay, any number of news sites, shopping sites, message boards and so on don’t need a massive amount of interactivity to be effective: they are mainly text and images, which is exactly what the web was designed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps your application adds most of its value on the _server side_ , by coordinating users or by applying sophisticated data analysis and then presenting it to a user. Perhaps your application adds value by simply sitting in front of a well-designed database, with simple Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations. Again, there is no shame in this!\n",
    "\n",
    "In any of these cases, using a hypermedia approach would likely be a great choice: the interactivity needs of these applications are not dramatic, and much of the value of these applications lives on the server side, rather than on the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these applications are amenable to what Roy Fielding called “large-grain hypermedia data transfers”: you can simply use anchor tags and forms, with responses that return entire HTML documents from requests, and things will work just fine. This is exactly what the web was designed to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting the hypermedia approach for these applications, you will save yourself a huge amount of client-side complexity that comes with adopting the Single Page Application approach: there is no need for client-side routing, for managing a client-side model, for hand-wiring in JavaScript logic, and so forth. The back button will “just work.” Deep linking will “just work.” You will be able to focus your efforts on your server, where your application is actually adding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, by layering htmx or another hypermedia-oriented library on top of this approach, you can address many of the usability issues that come with vanilla HTML and take advantage of finer-grained hypermedia transfers. This opens up a whole slew of new user interface and experience possibilities, making the set of applications that can be built using hypermedia _much_ larger.\n",

    "**Poorly built SPAs:** Yes, they might just stay at `mysite.com` regardless of what view you're on. The URL never changes, so sharing it just takes someone to the homepage.\n",

    "**Well-built SPAs:** Developers implement \"client-side routing\" to update the URL as you navigate (e.g., `mysite.com/#/products/42` or `mysite.com/products/42`). If done right, shared links *do* work — the JavaScript checks the URL on load and renders the right view.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case we have a highly dynamic user interface without clear boundaries as to what might need to be updated given a particular change. Introducing a hypermedia-style server round-trip on every cell change would hurt performance tremendously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is simply not a situation amenable to the “large-grain hypermedia data transfer” approach of the web. For an application like this we would certainly recommend looking into using a sophisticated client-side JavaScript approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "_However_ even in the case of an online spreadsheet there are likely areas where the hypermedia approach might help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet application likely also has a settings page. And perhaps that settings page _is_ amenable to the hypermedia approach. If it is simply a set of relatively straight-forward forms that need to be persisted to the server, the chances are good that hypermedia would, in fact, work great for this part of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, by adopting hypermedia for that part of your application, you might be able to simplify that part of the application quite a bit. You could then save more of your application’s _complexity budget_ for the core, complicated spreadsheet logic, keeping the simple stuff simple.\n",

    "Why waste all the complexity associated with a heavy JavaScript framework on something as simple as a settings page?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Complexity Budget**\n",
    "\n",
    "Any software project has a complexity budget, explicit or not: there is only so much complexity a given development team can tolerate and every new feature and implementation choice adds at least a bit more to the overall complexity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is particularly nasty about complexity is that it tends to grow exponentially: one day you can keep the entire system in your head and understand the ramifications of a particular change, and a week later the whole system seems intractable. Even worse, efforts to help control complexity, such as introducing abstractions or infrastructure to manage the complexity, often end up making things even more complex. Truly, the job of the good software engineer is to keep complexity under control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sure-fire way to keep complexity down is also the hardest: say no. Pushing back on feature requests is an art and, if you can learn to do it well, making people feel like _they_ said no, you will go far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly this is not always possible: some features will need to be built. At this point the question becomes: “what is the simplest thing that could possibly work?” Understanding the possibilities available in the hypermedia approach will give you another tool in your “simplest thing” tool chest.\n",

    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). These two tags alone powered the explosive growth of the early web.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GET vs POST**: GET appends data to URL as query parameters (shareable, bookmarkable). POST sends data in request body (hidden from URL, used for creating/updating).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **POST-Redirect-GET Pattern**: Server redirects after POST to prevent duplicate submissions on refresh. Developer chooses to redirect; browser follows automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code to know API structure (tight coupling). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with controls — server can change without breaking client (loose coupling). SPAs shift code/complexity to browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Not architectural superiority — practical necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`) — JavaScript handles mechanics, you declare intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when genuinely required (e.g., spreadsheets). Can mix: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be reimplemented in SPAs.\n",

    "**Learner Context**: New to web programming, comfortable with Python, prefers learning through discussion and exploring concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Covered**: \"Hypermedia: A Reintroduction\" from \"Hypermedia Systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia Definition**: Media with non-linear branching (e.g., hyperlinks). A **hypermedia control** encodes interaction information directly and completely within itself — self-describing, no external knowledge needed. Think about the *whole system*: HTML + HTTP + browser + server working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTML's Two Hypermedia Controls**: Anchor tags (navigation, GET) and form tags (data submission, GET/POST). Forms enabled the web to become an *application* platform, not just documents. GET appends data to URL (bookmarkable); POST sends data in body. POST-Redirect-GET pattern prevents duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**: SPAs exchange JSON data, require client-side code with intimate knowledge of API structure (**tight coupling**). Hypermedia exchanges HTML with embedded controls — server can change without breaking client (**loose coupling**). SPAs shift code/complexity to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why SPAs Won**: HTML froze as hypermedia in the mid-90s; user experience demands grew; JavaScript filled the gap. Won on *user experience*, not architectural superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs)**: Apps using hypermedia exchanges as primary server communication. Libraries like **htmx** extend HTML's capabilities with declarative attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-target`). **Important**: browsers don't natively understand these attributes — the htmx library scans for them, attaches behavior, handles requests/swaps; the browser just renders the resulting HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transitional vs Hypermedia-First**: Rich Harris's \"transitional\" approach = SPA as home base with MPA sprinkled in. The book's approach = **hypermedia as default**, SPA only when genuinely needed. The mindset is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **When to Use What**: Plain HTML → many apps. HTML + htmx → most interactivity needs. SPA → only when required (e.g., spreadsheets with cascading updates on every keystroke). **Can mix**: hypermedia for simple parts, SPA for complex features — save your complexity budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Browser Benefits \"For Free\"**: Back button, deep linking, caching — all work naturally with hypermedia; must be manually reimplemented in SPAs.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div> Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-known kind of messy HTML is `<div>` soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "When developers fall back on the generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements instead of more meaningful tags, we either degrade the quality of our websites or create more work for ourselves — probably both.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of adding a button using the dedicated `<button>` element, a `<div>` element might have a `click` event listener added to it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <div class=\"bg-accent padding-4 rounded-2\" onclick=\"doStuff()\">\n",
    "      Do stuff\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main issues with this button:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It’s not focusable — the Tab key won’t get you to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * There’s no way for assistive tools to tell that it’s a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can fix that by adding `role=\"button\"` and `tabindex=\"0\"`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <div class=\"bg-accent padding-4 rounded-2\"\n",
    "      role=\"button\"\n",
    "      tabindex=\"0\"\n",
    "      onclick=\"doStuff()\">Do stuff</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are easy fixes, but they’re things you have to _remember_. It’s also not obvious from the HTML source that this is a button, making the source harder to read and the absence of these attributes harder to spot. The source code of pages with div soup is difficult to edit and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid div soup, become friendly with the HTML spec of available tags, and consider each tag another tool in your tool chest. There might be things there you don’t remember from before! (With the 113 elements currently defined in the spec, it’s more of a tool _shed_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, not every UI pattern has a designated HTML element. We often need to compose elements and augment them with attributes. Before you do, though, rummage through the HTML tool chest. Sometimes you might be surprised by how much is available.\n",
