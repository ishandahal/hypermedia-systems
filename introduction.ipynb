    "This is a book about building applications using hypermedia systems. _Hypermedia systems_ might seem like a strange phrase: how is hypermedia a _system_? Isn’t hypermedia just a way to link documents together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with HTML, on the World Wide Web?\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you mean hypermedia _systems_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, yes, HTML is _a_ hypermedia. But there is more to the way the web works than just HTML: HTTP, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is what transfers HTML from servers to clients, and there are many details and features associated with it: caching, various headers, response codes, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, of course, there are _hypermedia servers_ , which present _hypermedia APIs_ (yes, _APIs_) to clients over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, finally, there is the all-important _hypermedia client_ : a software client that understands how to render a _hypermedia response_ intelligibly to a human, so that a human can interact with the remote system. The most widely known and used hypermedia clients are, of course, web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web browsers are perhaps the most sophisticated pieces of software we use. They not only understand HTML, CSS and many other file formats, but they also provide a JavaScript runtime and programming environment that is so powerful that web developers can create entire applications in it that are nearly as sophisticated as _thick clients_ , that is, native applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This JavaScript runtime is so powerful, in fact, that today many developers ignore the _hypermedia_ features of the browser, in favor of building their web applications entirely in JavaScript. Applications built in this manner have come to be called Single Page Applications (SPAs). Rather than navigating between pages, these web applications use JavaScript for updating the user interface directly. When they communicate with a server, these applications typically use JSON API calls via AJAX. And they often update the user interface using a “reactive” style frontend JavaScript library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these applications HTML becomes a (somewhat awkward) graphical interface description language that is used because, for historical reasons, that’s what happens to be there, in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications built in this style are not _hypermedia-driven_ : they do not take advantage of the underlying hypermedia system of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain what a hypermedia-driven application looks like, and to contrast it with the popular SPA approach of today, we need to first explore the entire _hypermedia system_ of the web, beyond just discussing HTML. We need to look at the _network architecture_ of the web, including how a web server delivers a hypermedia API, and how to effectively use the hypermedia features available in the hypermedia _client_ (e.g., the browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these are important aspects of building an effective hypermedia-driven application, and it is the entire _hypermedia system_ that comes together to make hypermedia such a powerful architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **\"Network architecture of the web\"** — This hints at how HTTP, caching, headers, and response codes all fit together as part of the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "That's a **data API** — the server sends back raw data (usually JSON), and the *client* has to know what to do with it. The client needs to be pre-programmed with knowledge of all the endpoints, what data they return, and how to display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hypermedia API** is different. Instead of sending just data, the server sends back *content that includes its own controls* — links and forms that tell the client what actions are possible *right now*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about when you visit a webpage: you don't need to know in advance what URLs exist on that site. The page itself shows you links you can click. The *server* is telling you your options through the hypermedia it sends.\n",

    "- A web server and a browser (like we've been discussing)\n",
    "- Two programs on the same computer\n",

    "- An operating system and applications running on it\n",
    "\n",

    "## What is a Hypermedia System?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what a hypermedia system is we’ll first take an in-depth look at _the_ canonical hypermedia system: the World Wide Web. Roy Fielding, an engineer who helped create specifications and build the implementations of many early pieces of the web, gave us the term REpresentational State Transfer, or REST. In his PhD dissertation he described REST as a _network architecture_ , and he contrasted it with earlier approaches to building distributed software.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a _hypermedia system_ as a system that adheres to the RESTful network architecture in Fielding’s _original_ sense of this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, today, you probably associate the term “REST” with JSON APIs, since that is where the term is typically used in industry. This is a misapplied use of the term REST because JSON is not a _natural_ hypermedia due to the absence of hypermedia controls. The exchange of hypermedia is an explicit requirement for a system to be considered “RESTful.” It is a long story how we got here, using the term REST so incorrectly, and we will go into the details later in this book. But, for now, if you think REST implies JSON, please try to set that understanding aside while reading this book, and come to the concept with fresh eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that, in his dissertation, Fielding was describing The World Wide Web as it existed in the late 1990s. The web, at that point, was simply web browsers exchanging hypermedia. That system, with its simple links and forms, was what Fielding was calling RESTful.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON APIs were a decade away from becoming a common tool in web development: REST was about _hypermedia_ and the 1.0 version of the web."

    "\n",
    "Absolutely! This connects nicely to what we discussed earlier about hypermedia APIs vs data APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST as Fielding meant it (late 1990s web):**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visited a webpage, the server sent HTML containing links and forms. Your browser rendered it, you clicked a link, the server sent *another* HTML page with *new* links and forms. The server guided you through the application by sending hypermedia — content with embedded controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key: each response told you what you could do next. The client (browser) didn't need special knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"REST\" as commonly used today:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /api/users/123  →  { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"Alice\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just data. No links, no forms, no controls. The client must *already know* all the endpoints and what to do with the data. The JSON itself doesn't tell you what actions are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The mismatch:**\n",
    "\n",
    "People started calling any HTTP API \"RESTful\" — especially if it used nice URLs and HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. But that misses Fielding's core point: REST requires **hypermedia** — responses that include their own controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON *can* include links (there are formats like HAL and JSON-API that try this), but it doesn't naturally, and most JSON APIs don't bother.\n",

So the way it's currently used, the JSON, which is called the \"restful\" is simply restful in a way that each API calls don't have to remember anything. So there is no state stored. However, the way fielding imagined would be the restful aspect of it being the entire content of transfer between server and the client which in this case is the browser Correct? So there is some aspect of restfulness in a sense that there is no state awareness in current way it is used but it's not how Fielding imagined it originally, is that correct? \n",

    "  * An introduction (or re-introduction) to hypermedia, with a particular focus on HTML and HTTP. We will finish this review of core hypermedia concepts by creating a simple “Web 1.0“-style application, Contact.app, for managing contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Next we will look at how we can use [htmx](https://htmx.org), a hypermedia-oriented JavaScript library created by the authors of this book, to improve Contact.app. By using htmx, we will be able to achieve a level of interactivity in our application that many developers would expect to require a large, sophisticated front end library, such as React. Thanks to htmx, we will be able to do this using hypermedia as our system architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Finally, we will look at a completely different hypermedia system, Hyperview. Hyperview is a _mobile_ hypermedia system, related to, but distinct from the web and created by one of the authors of this book – Adam Stepinski. It supports _mobile specific_ features by providing not only a mobile specific hypermedia, but also a mobile hypermedia client. These novel components, combined with any HTTP server, make it possible to build mobile Hypermedia-Driven Applications.\n",

Similarly, if you are well versed in htmx and want to dive into a novel _mobile_ hypermedia, you can skip ahead to the Hyperview section.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the book is designed to be read in order and both the htmx and Hyperview sections build on the Web 1.0 application described at the end of the first section. Furthermore, even if you _are_ well versed in all the concepts of hypermedia and details of HTML & HTTP, it is likely worth it to at least skim through the first few chapters for a refresher.\n",

It conveys the state of an application to people viewing our sites with a browser, as well as to people listening to screen readers that read sites aloud. It conveys the aims of our sites to search engines that scrape sites programmatically. It also conveys its behavior as clearly as possible to other developers.\n",
