    "Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "While there have been many books on the topic of hypermedia, there is a select number of publications that chronicle important advances in the field of hypermedia and this book is one of them. Not only does this book describe the benefits of creating hypermedia-driven applications (HDAs), it leads the reader through working and practical examples of how to do just that. And, in doing so, the authors (Gross, Stepinski, and Akşimşek) call out contributions from important figures in the history of hypermedia systems. And, as of this writing, that history spans more than half a century.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1974, Ted Nelson’s _“Computer Lib/Machine Dreams”_ marked the start of the modern hypermedia era with a book that Steven Levy (author of _“Hackers”_) described as “the epic of the computer revolution.” Nelson is credited with coining the terms HyperText, HyperLink, HyperMedia, and HyperData as well as Intertwingularity; the notion that all information is connected — both intertwined and intermingled. Almost half a century ago, he foretold a future where any person could publish anything anytime without the need for permission from any central controlling source. And his hyperlinks were the engine of that future.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took two decades before Nelson’s idea of intertwingled computing became widespread. Along the way, Douglas Engelbart created the _oN-Line System_ or NLS, Wendy Hall built the _Microcosm_ , and, eventually, in the 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee defined the World Wide Web (WWW), HTML, and HTTP. It was Berners-Lee’s iteration that has become the backbone and the standard for the intertwingularity we all experience today.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the year 2000, the technical foundations of “the web” were documented in Roy Fielding’s PhD dissertation _“Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures”_). In that work, Fielding defined the architectural model of _REpresentational State Transfer_ or REST. This set of system properties and implementation constraints have proven — even a quarter-century later — to be a reliable model for designing and building the intertwingled machines that today affect billions of people around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Fielding’s work was important, it wasn’t until Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby published _“RESTful Web Services”_ in 2008 that the REST model became well-known to the world of software architecture and development. Backed by the Ruby programming platform, the ideas behind Fielding’s REST model became _de rigueur_ for the creation of web-based services and client applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons Richardson and Ruby’s work was so important was that, unlike dissertations and futuristic predictions, the _RESTful Web Services_ book outlined a practical working framework for building powerful applications for the Web. It described not only the power of REST but also provided step-by-step instructions on how to build them. Richardson and Ruby brought together the hypermedia scholarship of the previous twenty years all in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we can add this book (_“Hypermedia Systems”_) to that list of important works. From the book’s introduction through the step-by-step directions on how to use HTMX for browsers and Hyperview for mobile devices, the authors describe the benefits of creating hypermedia-driven applications (HDAs). They also offer dozens of practical working examples the reader can use right away in building their own hypermedia solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been working in the field of hypermedia for close to thirty years and have seen quite a few books, papers, dissertations, and programming platforms come and go in that time. Occasionally, one of these works “nails it” — provides the right mix of theory and practice delivered in a way that helps readers make a connection between their own efforts and the activities of the community at large. I am happy to say that this book is one of those works. The authors have not only created powerful tooling in HTMX and Hyperview, they have also advanced the notion of hypermedia systems and hypermedia-driven applications in ways that a wide audience can understand and apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nelson describes a future where the barriers to publishing and data sharing are lowered and the creative energies of the world are easily shared and applied. This is neither a new or unique idea but one that does need continual renewal and encouragement. Nelson saw his hyperlink and hypermedia as the driving force for intertwingularity between people and machines around the world. In this idea alone, hypermedia is a powerful approach to creating computer systems that enable people to work together for the common good. As this book’s authors say, “Hypermedia was a great idea! It still is!”\n",

    "**What is REST and why does it matter?**\n",

    "REST stands for *REpresentational State Transfer*. It's a set of guidelines for how computers should talk to each other over the web.\n",

    "Here's a simple way to think about it: Imagine you're at a restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You (the client) look at a **menu** (a representation of what's available)\n",
    "2. You **request** something: \"I'd like the pasta\"\n",

    "- If you bring a friend, they have to learn a completely different system to order\n",
    "\n",
    "This is \"stateful\" — the server has to keep track of who you are and what you've done. It's fragile and doesn't scale well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant WITH REST**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every table gets a fresh menu (the current state of what's available)\n",
    "- The menu shows everything you can do: appetizers, mains, desserts, with prices\n",
    "- You make a request, you get a response — done\n",
    "- Any waiter can serve you because all the info is in the menu and your order\n",
    "- Your friend uses the exact same menu and system\n",
    "\n",
    "This is \"stateless\" — each interaction is self-contained. The menu (the hypermedia) tells you everything you need to know about what actions are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big win: REST systems are simpler, more reliable, and can handle millions of \"customers\" because the server isn't trying to remember everyone's history.\n",

    "This is the \"hypermedia\" approach — simple and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then things changed** (2010s onwards):\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers started building \"Single Page Applications\" (SPAs):\n",
    "- The browser loads one page, then uses JavaScript to fetch *just data* (often as JSON)\n",
    "- JavaScript rebuilds parts of the page without full reloads\n",
    "- Feels faster and more \"app-like\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem?**\n",
    "- The browser no longer receives hypermedia (HTML with links) — just raw data\n",
    "- The JavaScript has to \"know\" what links and actions are possible — it's hardcoded\n",
    "- More complex, more things can break, harder to maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this book argues**:\n",
    "The original hypermedia approach was actually great! Tools like HTMX let you get the \"app-like\" feel (partial page updates) while *still* using hypermedia — best of both worlds.\n",

    "Great questions! Let me break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why were SPAs introduced?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 2010s, developers wanted web apps to feel more like desktop or mobile apps:\n",
    "- No \"flash\" of a blank screen between pages\n",
    "- Faster-feeling interactions\n",
    "- Richer, more dynamic user interfaces (think Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "SPAs solved this by keeping one page loaded and updating parts of it dynamically with JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are SPAs still used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! SPAs are *very* popular today. Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular are widely used and are all SPA-oriented. Many of the apps you use daily are probably SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what's the book's point?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The book isn't saying SPAs are \"bad\" — they're saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SPAs added a lot of complexity that isn't always necessary\n",
    "2. Many apps don't *need* to be SPAs but were built that way because it became the default\n",
    "3. You can get many of the benefits (smooth partial updates) while keeping the simplicity of hypermedia\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more \"here's a simpler alternative you might not have considered\" rather than \"SPAs are wrong.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that help clarify? Would you like to know more about *when* an SPA makes sense vs when hypermedia might be a better fit?"

    "Perfect! Let's think about when each approach shines:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPAs make sense when**:\n",
    "- You need very rich, interactive UI (like a photo editor, drawing app, or complex dashboard)\n",
    "- You're building something that feels like a \"desktop app in the browser\"\n",
    "- You need to work offline or with minimal server communication\n",
    "- Example: Figma (design tool), Google Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypermedia makes sense when**:\n",
    "- You're building content-driven sites (blogs, e-commerce, forums)\n",
    "- Most interactions are \"click something, see new content\"\n",
    "- You want simpler code that's easier to maintain\n",
    "- You want better accessibility and SEO by default\n",
    "- Example: Amazon, Wikipedia, most business websites\n",
    "\n",
    "**The interesting middle ground** (what HTMX offers):\n",
    "- Start with hypermedia (simple, server sends HTML)\n",
    "- Add SPA-like smoothness only where needed (update just part of the page)\n",
    "- Keep it simple but still feel modern\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a website you use often. What kind of interactions does it have? Does it feel more like an \"app\" or more like clicking through pages?"

    "\n",
    "**Chapter Covered**: Foreword of \"Hypermedia Systems\" by Gross, Stepinski, and Akşimşek\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypermedia vs Regular Media**: Regular media is static (books, photos). Hypermedia is linked and interactive — content that connects to other content and responds to actions (clickable links, buttons).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **REST (REpresentational State Transfer)**: Guidelines for how computers talk over the web. Used restaurant analogy:\n",
    "   - *Without REST*: Waiter remembers your history, no menu, fragile, doesn't scale\n",
    "   - *With REST*: Fresh menu each visit, stateless, any waiter can serve you, self-contained interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evolution of Web Development**:\n",
    "   - Early web: Click → full page reload → server sends complete HTML with links (hypermedia approach)\n",
    "   - SPAs (2010s+): Single page loads, JavaScript fetches JSON data, rebuilds page parts — faster feel but more complex\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SPAs vs Hypermedia**:\n",
    "   - SPAs: Good for rich interactive apps (Figma, Google Docs), offline support, complex state\n",
    "   - Hypermedia: Good for content-driven sites, simpler code, easier maintenance\n",
    "   - HTMX: Middle ground — hypermedia with SPA-like smoothness where needed\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Book's Thesis**: Hypermedia was a great idea that got overlooked. Most apps don't need SPA complexity. Start simple, add complexity only when needed.\n",
